<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">STATEMENT OF THE RESOURCES FOR INVESTIGATING HISTORY, AND
PROOFS OF THE REGULARITY OF HUMAN ACTIONS. THESE ACTIONS
ARE GOVERNED BY MENTAL AND PHYSICAL LAWS: THEREFORE
BOTH SETS OF LAWS MUST BE STUDIED, AND THERE CAN BE NO
HISTORY WITHOUT THE NATURAL SCIENCES.</div>

<p>Of all the great branches of human knowledge, history
is that upon which most has been written, and
which has always been most popular. And it seems
to be the general opinion that the success of historians
has, on the whole, been equal to their industry;
and that if on this subject much has been studied,
much also is understood.</p>

<p>This confidence in the value of history is very
widely diffused, as we see in the extent to which it
is read, and in the share it occupies in all plans of
education. Nor can it be denied that, in a certain point
of view, such confidence is perfectly justifiable. It
cannot be denied that materials have been collected
which, when looked at in the aggregate, have a rich
and imposing appearance. The political and military
annals of all the great countries in Europe, and of
most of those out of Europe, have been carefully
compiled, put together in a convenient form, and
the evidence on which they rest has been tolerably
well sifted. Great attention has been paid to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
history of legislation, also to that of religion: while
considerable, though inferior, labour has been employed
in tracing the progress of science, of literature, of the
fine arts, of useful inventions, and, latterly, of the manners
and comforts of the people. In order to increase
our knowledge of the past, antiquities of every kind
have been examined; the sites of ancient cities have
been laid bare, coins dug up and deciphered, inscriptions
copied, alphabets restored, hieroglyphics interpreted,
and, in some instances, long-forgotten languages
reconstructed and re-arranged. Several of the laws
which regulate the changes of human speech have been
discovered, and, in the hands of philologists, have been
made to elucidate even the most obscure periods in the
early migration of nations. Political economy has been
raised to a science, and by it much light has been
thrown on the causes of that unequal distribution of
wealth which is the most fertile source of social disturbance.
Statistics have been so sedulously cultivated,
that we have the most extensive information, not only
respecting the material interests of men, but also respecting
their moral peculiarities; such as, the amount
of different crimes, the proportion they bear to each
other, and the influence exercised over them by age,
sex, education, and the like. With this great movement
physical geography has kept pace: the phenomena
of climate have been registered, mountains
measured, rivers surveyed and tracked to their source,
natural productions of all kinds carefully studied, and
their hidden properties unfolded: while every food
which sustains life has been chemically analysed, its
constituents numbered and weighed, and the nature of
the connexion between them and the human frame has,
in many cases, been satisfactorily ascertained. At the
same time, and that nothing should be left undone
which might enlarge our knowledge of the events by
which man is affected, there have been instituted circumstantial
researches in many other departments; so
that in regard to the most civilized people, we are now
acquainted with the rate of their mortality, of their
marriages, the proportion of their births, the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of their employments, and the fluctuations both in their
wages and in the prices of the commodities necessary
to their existence. These and similar facts have been
collected, methodized, and are ripe for use. Such
results, which form, as it were, the anatomy of a
nation, are remarkable for their minuteness; and to
them there have been joined other results less minute,
but more extensive. Not only have the actions and
characteristics of the great nations been recorded, but
a prodigious number of different tribes in all the parts
of the known world have been visited and described by
travellers, thus enabling us to compare the condition of
mankind in every stage of civilization, and under every
variety of circumstance. When we moreover add, that
this curiosity respecting our fellow-creatures is apparently
insatiable; that it is constantly increasing; that
the means of gratifying it are also increasing, and that
most of the observations which have been made are
still preserved;&mdash;when we put all these things together,
we may form a faint idea of the immense value of
that vast body of facts which we now possess, and by
the aid of which the progress of mankind is to be
investigated.</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, we are to describe the use
that has been made of these materials, we must draw a
very different picture. The unfortunate peculiarity of
the history of man is, that although its separate parts
have been examined with considerable ability, hardly
any one has attempted to combine them into a whole,
and ascertain the way in which they are connected with
each other. In all the other great fields of inquiry, the
necessity of generalization is universally admitted, and
noble efforts are being made to rise from particular
facts in order to discover the laws by which those facts
are governed. So far, however, is this from being the
usual course of historians, that among them a strange
idea prevails, that their business is merely to relate
events, which they may occasionally enliven by such
moral and political reflections as seem likely to be
useful. According to this scheme, any author who
from indolence of thought, or from natural incapacity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
is unfit to deal with the highest branches of knowledge,
has only to pass some years in reading a certain number
of books, and then he is qualified to be an historian;
he is able to write the history of a great people, and his
work becomes an authority on the subject which it
professes to treat.</p>

<p>The establishment of this narrow standard has led to
results very prejudicial to the progress of our knowledge.
Owing to it, historians, taken as a body, have
never recognized the necessity of such a wide and preliminary
study as would enable them to grasp their
subject in the whole of its natural relations. Hence
the singular spectacle of one historian being ignorant
of political economy; another knowing nothing of law;
another nothing of ecclesiastical affairs and changes of
opinion; another neglecting the philosophy of statistics,
and another physical science: although these topics are
the most essential of all, inasmuch as they comprise the
principal circumstances by which the temper and character
of mankind have been affected, and in which they
are displayed. These important pursuits being, however,
cultivated, some by one man, and some by another,
have been isolated rather than united: the aid which
might be derived from analogy and from mutual illustration
has been lost; and no disposition has been
shown to concentrate them upon history, of which they
are, properly speaking, the necessary components.</p>

<p>Since the early part of the eighteenth century, a few
great thinkers have indeed arisen, who have deplored
the backwardness of history, and have done everything
in their power to remedy it. But these instances have
been extremely rare: so rare, that in the whole literature
of Europe there are not more than three or four
really original works which contain a systematic attempt
to investigate the history of man according to those
exhaustive methods which in other branches of knowledge
have proved successful, and by which alone empirical
observations can be raised to scientific truths.</p>

<p>Among historians in general, we find, after the sixteenth
century, and especially during the last hundred
years, several indications of an increasing comprehensiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of view, and of a willingness to incorporate
into their works subjects which they would formerly
have excluded. By this means their assemblage of
topics has become more diversified, and the mere collection
and relative position of parallel facts has occasionally
suggested generalizations no traces of which can
be found in the earlier literature of Europe. This has
been a great gain, in so far as it has familiarized historians
with a wider range of thought, and encouraged
those habits of speculation, which, though liable to
abuse, are the essential condition of all real knowledge,
because without them no science can be constructed.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding that the prospects of historical
literature are certainly more cheering now than in any
former age, it must be allowed that, with extremely
few exceptions, they are only prospects, and that as yet
scarcely anything has been done towards discovering
the principles which govern the character and destiny
of nations. What has been actually effected I shall
endeavour to estimate in another part of this introduction:
at present it is enough to say, that for all the
higher purposes of human thought history is still
miserably deficient, and presents that confused and
anarchical appearance natural to a subject of which
the laws are unknown, and even the foundation unsettled.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Our acquaintance with history being so imperfect,
while our materials are so numerous, it seems desirable
that something should be done on a scale far larger
than has hitherto been attempted, and that a strenuous
effort should be made to bring up this great department
of inquiry to a level with other departments, in
order that we may maintain the balance and harmony
of our knowledge. It is in this spirit that the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
work has been conceived. To make the execution of it
fully equal to the conception is impossible: still I hope
to accomplish for the history of man something equivalent,
or at all events analogous, to what has been
effected by other inquirers for the different branches of
natural science. In regard to nature, events apparently
the most irregular and capricious have been explained,
and have been shown to be in accordance with certain
fixed and universal laws. This has been done because
men of ability, and, above all, men of patient, untiring
thought, have studied natural events with the view of
discovering their regularity: and if human events were
subjected to a similar treatment, we have every right
to expect similar results. For it is clear that they who
affirm that the facts of history are incapable of being
generalized, take for granted the very question at issue.
Indeed they do more than this. They not only assume
what they cannot prove, but they assume what in the
present state of knowledge is highly improbable. Whoever
is at all acquainted with what has been done
during the last two centuries, must be aware that every
generation demonstrates some events to be regular
and predictable, which the preceding generation had
declared to be irregular and unpredictable: so that
the marked tendency of advancing civilization is to
strengthen our belief in the universality of order, of
method, and of law. This being the case, it follows
that if any facts, or class of facts, have not yet been
reduced to order, we, so far from pronouncing them to
be irreducible, should rather be guided by our experience
of the past, and should admit the probability
that what we now call inexplicable will at some future
time be explained. This expectation of discovering
regularity in the midst of confusion is so familiar to
scientific men, that among the most eminent of them it
becomes an article of faith: and if the same expectation
is not generally found among historians, it must be
ascribed partly to their being of inferior ability to the
investigators of nature, and partly to the greater complexity
of those social phenomena with which their
studies are concerned.</p>

<p>Both these causes have retarded the creation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
science of history. The most celebrated historians are
manifestly inferior to the most successful cultivators of
physical science: no one having devoted himself to
history who in point of intellect is at all to be compared
with Kepler, Newton, or many others that might be
named.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And as to the greater complexity of the
phenomena, the philosophic historian is opposed by
difficulties far more formidable than is the student of
nature; since, while on the one hand, his observations
are more liable to those causes of error which arise
from prejudice and passion, he, on the other hand, is
unable to employ the great physical resource of experiment,
by which we can often simplify even the
most intricate problems in the external world.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, surprising that the study of the
movements of Man should be still in its infancy, as
compared with the advanced state of the study of the
movements of Nature. Indeed the difference between
the progress of the two pursuits is so great, that while
in physics the regularity of events, and the power of
predicting them, are often taken for granted even in
cases still unproved, a similar regularity is in history
not only not taken for granted, but is actually denied.
Hence it is that whoever wishes to raise history to a
level with other branches of knowledge, is met by a
preliminary obstacle; since he is told that in the affairs
of men there is something mysterious and providential,
which makes them impervious to our investigations,
and which will always hide from us their future course.
To this it might be sufficient to reply, that such an
assertion is gratuitous; that it is by its nature incapable
of proof; and that it is moreover opposed by the notorious
fact that everywhere else increasing knowledge
is accompanied by an increasing confidence in the
uniformity with which, under the same circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the same events must succeed each other. It will,
however, be more satisfactory to probe the difficulty
deeper, and inquire at once into the foundation of the
common opinion that history must always remain in its
present empirical state, and can never be raised to the
rank of a science. We shall thus be led to one vast
question, which indeed lies at the root of the whole
subject, and is simply this: Are the actions of men,
and therefore of societies, governed by fixed laws, or
are they the result either of chance or of supernatural
interference? The discussion of these alternatives
will suggest some speculations of considerable interest.</p>

<p>For, in reference to this matter, there are two doctrines,
which appear to represent different stages of
civilization. According to the first doctrine, every
event is single and isolated, and is merely considered
as the result of a blind chance. This opinion, which
is most natural to a perfectly ignorant people, would
soon be weakened by that extension of experience
which supplies a knowledge of those uniformities of
succession and of co-existence that nature constantly
presents. If, for example, wandering tribes, without
the least tincture of civilization, lived entirely by hunting
and fishing, they might well suppose that the
appearance of their necessary food was the result of
some accident which admitted of no explanation. The
irregularity of the supply, and the apparent caprice
with which it was sometimes abundant and sometimes
scanty, would prevent them from suspecting anything
like method in the arrangements of nature; nor could
their minds even conceive the existence of those general
principles which govern the order of events, and by a
knowledge of which we are often able to predict their
future course. But when such tribes advance into the
agricultural state, they, for the first time, use a food of
which not only the appearance, but the very existence,
seems to be the result of their own act. What they
sow, that likewise do they reap. The provision necessary
for their wants is brought more immediately under
their own control, and is more palpably the consequence
of their own labour. They perceive a distinct plan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and a regular uniformity of sequence, in the relation
which the seed they put into the ground bears to the
corn when arrived at maturity. They are now able to
look to the future, not indeed with certainty, but with
a confidence infinitely greater than they could have felt
in their former and more precarious pursuits.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Hence
there arises a dim idea of the stability of events; and
for the first time there begins to dawn upon the mind a
faint conception of what at a later period are called the
Laws of Nature. Every step in the great progress will
make their view of this more clear. As their observations
accumulate, and as their experience extends over
a wider surface, they meet with uniformities that they
had never suspected to exist, and the discovery of which
weakens that doctrine of chance with which they had
originally set out. Yet a little further, and a taste for
abstract reasoning springs up; and then some among
them generalize the observations that have been made,
and despising the old popular opinion, believe that
every event is linked to its antecedent by an inevitable
connexion, that such antecedent is connected with a
preceding fact; and that thus the whole world forms
a necessary chain, in which indeed each man may play
his part, but can by no means determine what that part
shall be.</p>

<p>Thus it is that, in the ordinary march of society, an
increasing perception of the regularity of nature destroys
the doctrine of Chance, and replaces it by that
of Necessary Connexion. And it is, I think, highly
probable that out of these two doctrines of Chance and
Necessity there have respectively arisen the subsequent
dogmas of Free Will and Predestination. Nor is it
difficult to understand the manner in which, in a more
advanced state of society, this metamorphosis would
occur. In every country, as soon as the accumulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of wealth has reached a certain point, the produce of
each man's labour becomes more than sufficient for his
own support: it is therefore no longer necessary that
all should work; and there is formed a separate class,
the members of which pass their lives for the most
part in the pursuit of pleasure; a very few, however,
in the acquisition and diffusion of knowledge. Among
these last there are always found some who, neglecting
external events, turn their attention to the study of
their own minds;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and such men, when possessed of
great abilities, become the founders of new philosophies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and new religions, which often exercise immense influence
over the people who receive them. But the
authors of these systems are themselves affected by the
character of the age in which they live. It is impossible
for any man to escape the pressure of surrounding
opinions; and what is called a new philosophy or a new
religion is generally not so much a creation of fresh
ideas, but rather a new direction given to ideas already
current among contemporary thinkers.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Thus, in the
case now before us, the doctrine of Chance in the
external world corresponds to that of Free Will in the
internal: while the other doctrine of Necessary Connexion
is equally analogous to that of Predestination;
the only difference being that the first is a development
by the metaphysician, the second by the theologian. In
the first instance, the metaphysician setting out with
the doctrine of Chance, carries into the study of the
mind this arbitrary and irresponsible principle, which
in its new field becomes Free Will; an expression by
which all difficulties seem to be removed, since perfect
freedom, itself the cause of all actions, is caused by none,
but, like the doctrine of Chance, is an ultimate fact
admitting of no further explanation.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In the second
instance, the theologian taking up the doctrine of
Necessary Connexion recasts it into a religious shape;
and his mind being already full of conceptions of order
and of uniformity, he naturally ascribes such undeviating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
regularity to the prescience of Supreme Power; and
thus to the magnificent notion of One God there is
added the dogma that by Him all things have from
the beginning been absolutely pre-determined and preordained.</p>

<p>These opposite doctrines of free will and predestination<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
do, no doubt, supply a safe and simple solution of
the obscurities of our being; and as they are easily
understood, they are so suited to the average capacity
of the human mind, that even at the present day an
immense majority of men are divided between them;
and they have not only corrupted the sources of our
knowledge, but have given rise to religious sects, whose
mutual animosities have disturbed society, and too often
embittered the relations of private life. Among the
more advanced European thinkers there is, however, a
growing opinion that both doctrines are wrong or, at
all events, that we have no sufficient evidence of their
truth. And as this is a matter of great moment, it is
important, before we proceed further, to clear up as
much of it as the difficulties inherent in these subjects
will enable us to do.</p>

<p>Whatever doubts may be thrown on the account
which I have given of the probable origin of the ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of free will and predestination, there can, at all events,
be no dispute as to the foundation on which those ideas
are now actually based. The theory of predestination
is founded on a theological hypothesis; that of free will
on a metaphysical hypothesis. The advocates of the
first proceed on a supposition for which, to say the least
of it, they have as yet brought forward no good
evidence. They require us to believe that the Author
of Creation, whose beneficence they at the same time
willingly allow, has, notwithstanding His supreme goodness,
made an arbitrary distinction between the elect
and the non-elect; that He has from all eternity doomed
to perdition millions of creatures yet unborn, and whom
His act alone can call into existence: and that He has
done this, not in virtue of any principle of justice, but
by a mere stretch of despotic power.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This doctrine
owes its authority among Protestants to the dark though
powerful mind of Calvin; but in the early Church it
was first systematically methodized by Augustin, who
appears to have borrowed it from the Manicheans.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> At
all events, and putting aside its incompatibility with
other notions which are supposed to be fundamental,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it must, in a scientific investigation, be regarded as a
barren hypothesis, because, being beyond the province
of our knowledge, we have no means of ascertaining
either its truth or its falsehood.</p>

<p>The other doctrine, which has long been celebrated
under the name of Free Will, is connected with Arminianism;
but it in reality rests on the metaphysical
dogma of the supremacy of human consciousness.
Every man, it is alleged, feels and knows that he is a
free agent: nor can any subtleties of argument do away
with our consciousness of possessing a free will.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Now
the existence of this supreme jurisdiction, which is thus
to set at defiance all the ordinary methods of reasoning,
involves two assumptions: of which the first, though
possibly true, has never been proved; and the other is
unquestionably false. These assumptions are, that there
is an independent faculty called consciousness, and that
the dictates of that faculty are infallible. But, in the
first place, it is by no means certain that consciousness
is a faculty; and some of the ablest thinkers have been
of opinion that it is merely a state or condition of the
mind.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Should this turn out to be the case, the argument
falls to the ground; since, even if we admit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
all the faculties of the mind, when completely exercised,
are equally accurate, no one will make the same claim
for every condition into which the mind itself may be
casually thrown. However, waiving this objection, we
may, in the second place, reply, that even if consciousness
is a faculty, we have the testimony of all history
to prove its extreme fallibility.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> All the great stages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
through which, in the progress of civilization, the
human race has successively passed, have been characterized
by certain mental peculiarities or convictions,
which have left their impress upon the religion, the
philosophy, and the morals of the age. Each of these
convictions has been to one period a matter of faith, to
another a matter for derision;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and each of them has,
in its own epoch, been as intimately bound up with the
minds of men, and become as much a part of their
consciousness, as is that opinion which we now term
freedom of the will. Yet it is impossible that all these
products of consciousness can be true, because many of
them contradict each other. Unless, therefore, in different
ages there are different standards of truth, it is
clear that the testimony of a man's consciousness is no
proof of an opinion being true; for if it were so, then
two propositions diametrically opposed to each other
might both be equally accurate. Besides this, another
view may be drawn from the common operations of
ordinary life. Are we not in certain circumstances
conscious of the existence of spectres and phantoms;
and yet is it not generally admitted that such beings
have no existence at all? Should it be attempted to
refute this argument by saying that such consciousness
is apparent and not real, then I ask, What is it that
judges between the consciousness which is genuine and
that which is spurious?<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> If this boasted faculty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
deceives us in some things, what security have we that
it will not deceive us in others? If there is no security,
the faculty is not trustworthy. If there is a security,
then, whatever it may be, its existence shows the necessity
for some authority to which consciousness is subordinate,
and thus does away with that doctrine of the
supremacy of consciousness, on which the advocates of
free will are compelled to construct the whole of their
theory. Indeed, the uncertainty as to the existence of
consciousness as an independent faculty, and the manner
in which that faculty, if it exists, has contradicted its
own suggestions, are two of the many reasons which
have long since convinced me that metaphysics will
never be raised to a science by the ordinary method of
observing individual minds; but that its study can only
be successfully prosecuted by the deductive application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of laws which must be discovered historically, that is
to say, which must be evolved by an examination of the
whole of those vast phenomena which the long course
of human affairs presents to our view.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, for the object of this work,
the believer in the possibility of a science of history is
not called upon to hold either the doctrine of predestined
events, or that of freedom of the will;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and
the only positions which, in this stage of the inquiry,
I shall expect him to concede are the following: That
when we perform an action, we perform it in consequence
of some motive or motives; that those motives
are the results of some antecedents; and that, therefore,
if we were acquainted with the whole of the antecedents,
and with all the laws of their movements, we could
with unerring certainty predict the whole of their
immediate results. This, unless I am greatly mistaken,
is the view which must be held by every man whose
mind is unbiased by system, and who forms his opinions
according to the evidence actually before him.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> If, for
example, I am intimately acquainted with the character
of any person, I can frequently tell how he will act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
under some given circumstances. Should I fail in this
prediction, I must ascribe my error not to the arbitrary
and capricious freedom of his will, nor to any supernatural
pre-arrangement, for of neither of these things
have we the slightest proof; but I must be content to
suppose either that I had been misinformed as to some
of the circumstances in which he was placed, or else
that I had not sufficiently studied the ordinary operations
of his mind. If, however, I were capable of
correct reasoning, and if, at the same time, I had a
complete knowledge both of his disposition and of all
the events by which he was surrounded, I should be
able to foresee the line of conduct which, in consequence
of those events, he would adopt.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Rejecting, then, the metaphysical dogma of free will,
and the theological dogma of predestined events,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
are driven to the conclusion that the actions of men,
being determined solely by their antecedents, must have
a character of uniformity, that is to say, must, under
precisely the same circumstances, always issue in precisely
the same results. And as all antecedents are
either in the mind or out of it, we clearly see that all
the variations in the results, in other words, all the
changes of which history is full, all the vicissitudes of
the human race, their progress or their decay, their happiness
or their misery, must be the fruit of a double
action; an action of external phenomena upon the mind,
and another action of the mind upon the phenomena.</p>

<p>These are the materials out of which a philosophic
history can alone be constructed. On the one hand, we
have the human mind obeying the laws of its own
existence, and, when uncontrolled by external agents,
developing itself according to the conditions of its
organization. On the other hand, we have what is
called Nature, obeying likewise its laws; but incessantly
coming into contact with the minds of men, exciting
their passions, stimulating their intellect, and therefore
giving to their actions a direction which they would
not have taken without such disturbance. Thus we
have man modifying nature, and nature modifying
man; while out of this reciprocal modification all
events must necessarily spring.</p>

<p>The problem immediately before us, is to ascertain
the method of discovering the laws of this double
modification: and this, as we shall presently see, leads
us into a preliminary inquiry as to which of the two
modifications is the more important; that is to say,
whether the thoughts and desires of men are more
influenced by physical phenomena, or whether the
physical phenomena are more influenced by them. For
it is evident that whichever class is the more active,
should if possible be studied before the other; and
this, partly because its results will be more prominent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and therefore more easy to observe; and partly because
by first generalizing the laws of the greater power we
shall leave a smaller residue of unexplained facts than
if we had begun by generalizing the laws of the lesser
power. But, before entering into this examination, it
will be convenient to state some of the most decisive
proofs we now possess of the regularity with which
mental phenomena succeed each other. By this means
the preceding views will be considerably strengthened;
and we shall, at the same time, be able to see what
those resources are which have been already employed
in elucidating this great subject.</p>

<p>That the results actually effected are extremely
valuable is evident, not only from the wide surface
which the generalizations cover, but also from the
extraordinary precautions with which they have been
made. For while most moral inquiries have depended
on some theological or metaphysical hypothesis, the investigations
to which I allude are exclusively inductive;
they are based on collections of almost innumerable
facts, extending over many countries, thrown into the
clearest of all forms, the form of arithmetical tables;
and finally, they have been put together by men who,
being for the most part mere government officials,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
had no particular theory to maintain, and no interest
in distorting the truth of the reports they were directed
to make.</p>

<p>The most comprehensive inferences respecting the
actions of men, which are admitted by all parties as
incontestable truths, are derived from this or from
analogous sources; they rest on statistical evidence,
and are expressed in mathematical language. And
whoever is aware of how much has been discovered by
this single method, must not only recognize the uniformity
with which mental phenomena succeed each
other, but must, I think, feel sanguine that still more
important discoveries will be made, so soon as there
are brought into play those other powerful resources
which even the present state of knowledge will abundantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
supply. Without, however, anticipating future
inquiries, we are, for the moment, only concerned with
those proofs of the existence of a uniformity in human
affairs which statisticians have been the first to bring
forward.</p>

<p>The actions of men are by an easy and obvious
division separated into two classes, the virtuous and
the vicious; and as these classes are correlative, and
when put together compose the total of our moral
conduct, it follows that whatever increases the one, will
in a relative point of view diminish the other; so that if
we can in any period detect a uniformity and a method
in the vices of a people, there must be a corresponding
regularity in their virtues; or if we could prove a
regularity in their virtues, we should necessarily infer
an equal regularity in their vices; the two sets of
actions being, according to the terms of the division,
merely supplementary to each other.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Or, to express
this proposition in another way, it is evident that if it
can be demonstrated that the bad actions of men vary
in obedience to the changes in the surrounding society,
we shall be obliged to infer that their good actions,
which are, as it were, the residue of their bad ones,
vary in the same manner; and we shall be forced to
the further conclusion, that such variations are the
result of large and general causes, which, working upon
the aggregate of society, must produce certain consequences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
without regard to the volition of those
particular men of whom the society is composed.</p>

<p>Such is the regularity we expect to find, if the
actions of men are governed by the state of the society
in which they occur; while, on the other hand, if we
can find no such regularity, we may believe that their
actions depend on some capricious and personal principle
peculiar to each man, as free will or the like. It
becomes, therefore, in the highest degree important to
ascertain whether or not there exists a regularity in the
entire moral conduct of a given society; and this is
precisely one of those questions for the decision of
which statistics supply us with materials of immense
value.</p>

<p>For the main object of legislation being to protect
the innocent against the guilty, it naturally followed
that European governments, so soon as they became
aware of the importance of statistics, should begin
to collect evidence respecting the crimes they were
expected to punish. This evidence has gone on accumulating,
until it now forms of itself a large body of
literature, containing, with the commentaries connected
with it, an immense array of facts, so carefully compiled,
and so well and clearly digested, that more may be
learned from it respecting the moral nature of Man
than can be gathered from all the accumulated experience
of preceding ages.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But as it will be impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in this Introduction to give anything like a complete
statement of those inferences which, in the actual state
of statistics, we are authorized to draw, I shall content
myself with examining two or three of the most
important, and pointing out the connexion between
them.</p>

<p>Of all offences, it might well be supposed that the
crime of murder is one of the most arbitrary and
irregular. For when we consider that this, though
generally the crowning act of a long career of vice, is
often the immediate result of what seems a sudden
impulse; that when premeditated, its committal, even
with the least chance of impunity, requires a rare
combination of favourable circumstances for which the
criminal will frequently wait; that he has thus to bide
his time, and look for opportunities he cannot control;
that when the time has come his heart may fail him;
that the question whether or not he shall commit the
crime may depend on a balance of conflicting motives,
such as fear of the law, a dread of the penalties held
out by religion, the prickings of his own conscience,
the apprehension of future remorse, the love of gain,
jealousy, revenge, desperation;&mdash;when we put all these
things together, there arises such a complication of
causes, that we might reasonably despair of detecting
any order or method in the result of those subtle and
shifting agencies by which murder is either caused or
prevented. But now, how stands the fact? The fact
is, that murder is committed with as much regularity,
and bears as uniform a relation to certain known circumstances,
as do the movements of the tides, and the
rotations of the seasons. M. Quetelet, who has spent
his life in collecting and methodizing the statistics of
different countries, states, as the result of his laborious
researches, that &lsquo;in everything which concerns crime,
the same numbers re-occur with a constancy which
cannot be mistaken; and that this is the case even
with those crimes which seem quite independent of
human foresight, such, for instance, as murders, which
are generally committed after quarrels arising from
circumstances apparently casual. Nevertheless, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
know from experience that every year there not only
take place nearly the same number of murders, but that
even the instruments by which they are committed are
employed in the same proportion.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This was the
language used in 1835 by confessedly the first statistician
in Europe, and every subsequent investigation
has confirmed its accuracy. For later inquiries have
ascertained the extraordinary fact that the uniform
reproduction of crime is more clearly marked, and
more capable of being predicted, than are the physical
laws connected with the disease and destruction of our
bodies. Thus, for instance, the number of persons
accused of crime in France between 1826 and 1844
was, by a singular coincidence, about equal to the male
deaths which took place in Paris during the same
period, the difference being that the fluctuations in the
amount of crime were actually smaller than the fluctuations
in the mortality; while a similar regularity
was observed in each separate offence, all of which obeyed
the same law of uniform and periodical repetition.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>This, indeed, will appear strange to those who believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that human actions depend more upon the peculiarities
of each individual than on the general state of society.
But another circumstance remains behind still more
striking. Among public and registered crimes there
is none which seems so completely dependent on the
individual as suicide. Attempts to murder or to rob
may be, and constantly are, successfully resisted; baffled
sometimes by the party attacked, sometimes by the
officers of justice. But an attempt to commit suicide
is much less liable to interruption. The man who is
determined to kill himself is not prevented at the last
moment by the struggles of an enemy; and, as he
can easily guard against the interference of the civil
power,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> his act becomes as it were isolated; it is cut
off from foreign disturbances, and seems more clearly
the product of his own volition than any other offence
could possibly be. We may also add that, unlike
crimes in general, it is rarely caused by the instigation
of confederates; so that men, not being goaded into it
by their companions, are uninfluenced by one great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
class of external associations which might hamper what
is termed the freedom of their will. It may, therefore,
very naturally be thought impracticable to refer suicide
to general principles, or to detect anything like regularity
in an offence which is so eccentric, so solitary,
so impossible to control by legislation, and which the
most vigilant police can do nothing to diminish. There
is also another obstacle that impedes our view: this is,
that even the best evidence respecting suicide must
always be very imperfect. In cases of drowning, for
example, deaths are liable to be returned as suicides
which are accidental; while, on the other hand, some
are called accidental which are voluntary.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Thus it is,
that self-murder seems to be not only capricious and
uncontrollable, but also very obscure in regard to proof;
so that on all these grounds it might be reasonable to
despair of ever tracing it to those general causes by
which it is produced.</p>

<p>These being the peculiarities of this singular crime,
it is surely an astonishing fact, that all the evidence we
possess respecting it points to one great conclusion, and
can leave no doubt on our minds that suicide is merely
the product of the general condition of society, and
that the individual felon only carries into effect what is
a necessary consequence of preceding circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
In a given state of society, a certain number of persons
must put an end to their own life. This is the general
law; and the special question as to who shall commit
the crime depends, of course, upon special laws; which,
however, in their total action, must obey the large social
law to which they are all subordinate. And the power
of the larger law is so irresistible, that neither the love
of life nor the fear of another world can avail anything
towards even checking its operation. The causes of
this remarkable regularity I shall hereafter examine;
but the existence of the regularity is familiar to whoever
is conversant with moral statistics. In the different
countries for which we have returns, we find year by
year the same proportion of persons putting an end to
their own existence; so that, after making allowance
for the impossibility of collecting complete evidence, we
are able to predict, within a very small limit of error,
the number of voluntary deaths for each ensuing period;
supposing, of course, that the social circumstances do
not undergo any marked change. Even in London, notwithstanding
the vicissitudes incidental to the largest
and most luxurious capital in the world, we find a
regularity greater than could be expected by the most
sanguine believer in social laws; since political excitement,
mercantile excitement, and the misery produced
by the dearness of food, are all causes of suicide, and
are all constantly varying.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Nevertheless, in this vast
metropolis, about 240 persons every year make away
with themselves; the annual suicides oscillating, from
the pressure of temporary causes, between 266, the
highest, and 213, the lowest. In 1846, which was the
great year of excitement caused by the railway panic,
the suicides in London were 266; in 1847 began a slight
improvement, and they fell to 256; in 1848 they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
247; in 1849 they were 213; and in 1850 they were
229.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Such is some, and only some, of the evidence we now
possess respecting the regularity with which, in the
same state of society, the same crimes are necessarily
reproduced. To appreciate the full force of this evidence,
we must remember that it is not an arbitrary selection
of particular facts, but that it is generalized from an
exhaustive statement of criminal statistics, consisting
of many millions of observations, extending over
countries in different grades of civilization, with different
laws, different opinions, different morals, different
habits. If we add to this, that these statistics have
been collected by persons specially employed for that
purpose, with every means of arriving at the truth,
and with no interest to deceive, it surely must be
admitted that the existence of crime according to a
fixed and uniform scheme, is a fact more clearly attested
than any other in the moral history of man. We have
here parallel chains of evidence formed with extreme
care, under the most different circumstances, and all
pointing in the same direction; all of them forcing us
to the conclusion, that the offences of men are the
result not so much of the vices of the individual offender
as of the state of society into which that individual is
thrown.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> This is an inference resting on broad and
tangible proofs accessible to all the world; and as
such cannot be overturned, or even impeached, by any
of those hypotheses with which metaphysicians and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
theologians have hitherto perplexed the study of past
events.</p>

<p>Those readers who are acquainted with the manner
in which in the physical world the operations of the
laws of nature are constantly disturbed, will expect to
find in the moral world disturbances equally active.
Such aberrations proceed, in both instances, from minor
laws, which at particular points meet the larger laws,
and thus alter their normal action. Of this, the science
of mechanics affords a good example in the instance of
that beautiful theory called the parallelogram of forces;
according to which the forces are to each other in the
same proportion as is the diagonal of their respective
parallelograms.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This is a law pregnant with great
results; it is connected with those important mechanical
resources, the composition and resolution of forces;
and no one acquainted with the evidence on which it
stands, ever thought of questioning its truth. But the
moment we avail ourselves of it for practical purposes,
we find that in its action it is warped by other laws,
such as those concerning the friction of air, and the
different density of the bodies on which we operate,
arising from their chemical composition, or, as some
suppose, from their atomic arrangement. Perturbations
being thus let in, the pure and simple action of the
mechanical law disappears. Still, and although the
results of the law are incessantly disturbed, the law
itself remains intact.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Just in the same way, the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
social law, that the moral actions of men are the product
not of their volition, but of their antecedents, is
itself liable to disturbances which trouble its operation
without affecting its truth. And this is quite sufficient
to explain those slight variations which we find from
year to year in the total amount of crime produced by
the same country. Indeed, looking at the fact that the
moral world is far more abundant in materials than the
physical world, the only ground for astonishment is
that these variations should not be greater; and from
the circumstance that the discrepancies are so trifling,
we may form some idea of the prodigious energy of
those vast social laws, which, though constantly interrupted,
seem to triumph over every obstacle, and which,
when examined by the aid of large numbers, scarcely
undergo any sensible perturbation.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Nor is it merely the crimes of men which are marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
by this uniformity of sequence. Even the number of
marriages annually contracted, is determined, not by
the temper and wishes of individuals, but by large
general facts, over which individuals can exercise no
authority. It is now known that marriages bear a
fixed and definite relation to the price of corn;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and
in England the experience of a century has proved
that, instead of having any connexion with personal
feelings, they are simply regulated by the average
earnings of the great mass of the people:<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> so that
this immense social and religious institution is not
only swayed, but is completely controlled, by the price
of food and by the rate of wages. In other cases,
uniformity has been detected, though the causes of
the uniformity are still unknown. Thus, to give a
curious instance, we are now able to prove that even
the aberrations of memory are marked by this general
character of necessary and invariable order. The post-offices
of London and of Paris have latterly published
returns of the number of letters which the writers,
through forgetfulness, omitted to direct; and, making
allowance for the difference of circumstances, the returns
are year after year copies of each other. Year
after year the same proportion of letter-writers forget
this simple act; so that for each successive period
we can actually foretell the number of persons whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
memory will fail them in regard to this trifling and, as
it might appear, accidental occurrence.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>To those who have a steady conception of the regularity
of events, and have firmly seized the great truth
that the actions of men, being guided by their antecedents,
are in reality never inconsistent, but, however
capricious they may appear, only form part of one vast
scheme of universal order, of which we in the present
state of knowledge can barely see the outline&mdash;to those
who understand this, which is at once the key and the
basis of history, the facts just adduced, so far from
being strange, will be precisely what would have been
expected and ought long since to have been known.
Indeed, the progress of inquiry is becoming so rapid
and so earnest, that I entertain little doubt that before
another century has elapsed, the chain of evidence will
be complete, and it will be as rare to find an historian
who denies the undeviating regularity of the moral
world, as it now is to find a philosopher who denies
the regularity of the material world.</p>

<p>It will be observed, that the preceding proofs of our
actions being regulated by law, have been derived from
statistics; a branch of knowledge which, though still
in its infancy,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> has already thrown more light on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the study of human nature than all the sciences put
together. But although the statisticians have been
the first to investigate this great subject by treating
it according to those methods of reasoning which in
other fields have been found successful; and although
they have, by the application of numbers, brought to
bear upon it a very powerful engine for eliciting truth&mdash;we
must not, on that account, suppose that there are
no other resources remaining by which it may likewise
be cultivated: nor should we infer that because the
physical sciences have not yet been applied to history,
they are therefore inapplicable to it. Indeed, when we
consider the incessant contact between man and the
external world, it is certain that there must be an intimate
connexion between human actions and physical
laws; so that if physical science had not hitherto been
brought to bear upon history, the reason is, either that
historians have not perceived the connexion, or else
that, having perceived it, they have been destitute of
the knowledge by which its workings can be traced.
Hence there has arisen an unnatural separation of the
two great departments of inquiry, the study of the
internal and that of the external: and although, in
the present state of European literature, there are
some unmistakable symptoms of a desire to break
down this artificial barrier, still it must be admitted
that as yet nothing has been actually accomplished
towards effecting so great an end. The moralists, the
theologians, and the metaphysicians, continue to prosecute
their studies without much respect for what they
deem the inferior labours of scientific men; whose inquiries,
indeed, they frequently attack, as dangerous to
the interests of religion, and as inspiring us with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
undue confidence in the resources of the human understanding.
On the other hand, the cultivators of
physical science, conscious that they are an advancing
body, are naturally proud of their own success; and,
contrasting their discoveries with the more stationary
position of their opponents, are led to despise pursuits
the barrenness of which has now become notorious.</p>

<p>It is the business of the historian to mediate between
these two parties, and reconcile their hostile pretensions
by showing the point at which their respective studies
ought to coalesce. To settle the terms of this coalition,
will be to fix the basis of all history. For since history
deals with the actions of men, and since their actions
are merely the product of a collision between internal
and external phenomena, it becomes necessary to examine
the relative importance of those phenomena; to
inquire into the extent to which their laws are known;
and to ascertain the resources for future discovery
possessed by these two great classes, the students of
the mind and the students of nature. This task I
shall endeavour to accomplish in the next two chapters:
and if I do so with anything approaching to
success, the present work will at least have the merit
of contributing something towards filling up that
wide and dreary chasm, which, to the hindrance of
our knowledge, separates subjects that are intimately
related, and should never be disunited.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Der Begriff der Freiheit ist ein reiner Vernunftbegriff, der eben
darum für die theoretische Philosophie transcendent, d. i. ein solcher
ist, dem kein angemessenes Beispiel in irgend einer möglichen
Erfahrung gegeben werden kann, welcher also keinen Gegenstand
einer uns möglichen theoretischen Erkenntniss ausmacht, und
schlechterdings nicht für ein constitutives, sondern lediglich als
regulatives, und zwar nur bloss negatives Princip der speculativen
Vernunft gelten kann, im praktischen Gebrauche der selben aber
seine Realität durch praktische Grundsätze beweist, die, als Gesetze,
eine Causalität der reinen Vernunft, unabhängig von allen empirischen
Bedingungen (dem Sinnlichen überhaupt), die Willkühr zu bestimmen,
und einen reinen Willen in uns beweisen, in welchem die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
sittlichen Begriffe und Gesetze ihren Ursprung haben.&rsquo; <i>Metaphysik
der Sitten</i>, in <i>Kant's Werke</i>, vol. v. pp. 20, 21. &lsquo;Würden die Gegenstände
der Sinnenwelt für Dinge an sich selbst genommen, und die
oben angeführten Naturgesetze für Gesetze der Dinge an sich selbst,
so wäre der Widerspruch&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> between Liberty and Necessity)
&lsquo;unvermeidlich. Ebenso, wenn das Subject der Freiheit gleich den
übrigen Gegenständen als blose Erscheinung vorgestellt würde, so
könnte ebensowohl der Widerspruch nicht vermieden werden; denn
es würde ebendasselbe von einerlei Gegenständen in derselben
Bedeutung zugleich bejaht und verneint werden. Ist aber Naturnothwendigkeit
bloss auf Erscheinungen bezogen, und Freiheit bloss
auf Dinge an sich selbst, so entspringt kein Widerspruch, wenn man
gleich beide Arten von Causalität annimmt oder zugibt, so schwer
oder unmöglich es auch sein möchte, die von der letzteren Art
begreiflich zu machen.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Natur also und Freiheit eben
demselben Dinge, aber in verschiedener Beziehung, einmal als
Erscheinung, das andre Mal als einem Dinge an sich selbst ohne
Widerspruch beigelegt werden können.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Nun kann ich
ohne Widerspruch sagen: alle Handlungen vernünftiger Wesen,
sofern sie Erscheinungen sind (in irgend einer Erfahrung angetroffen
werden), stehen unter der Naturnothwendigkeit; eben dieselben
Handlungen aber, bloss respective auf das vernünftige Subject und
dessen Vermögen, nach blosser Vernunft zu handeln, sind frei.&rsquo;
<i>Prolegomena zu jeder künftigen Metaphysik</i>, in <i>Kant's Werke</i>, vol.
iii. pp. 268&ndash;270. &lsquo;Denn ein Geschöpf zu sein und als Naturwesen
bloss dem Willen seines Urhebers zu folgen; dennoch aber als freihandelndes
Wesen (welches seinen vom äusseren Einfluss unabhängigen
Willen hat, der dem ersteren vielfältig zuwider sein kann),
der Zurechnung fähig zu sein, und seine eigene That doch auch
zugleich als die Wirkung eines höheren Wesens anzusehen: ist eine
Vereinbarung von Begriffen, die wir zwar in der Idee einer Welt,
als des höchsten Gutes, zusammen denken müssen; die aber nur der
einsehen kann, welcher bis zur Kenntniss der übersinnlichen (intelligiblen)
Welt durchdringt und die Art einsieht, wie sie der Sinnenwelt
zum Grunde liegt.&rsquo; <i>Theodicee</i>, in <i>Kant's Werke</i>, vol. vi. p. 149.
&lsquo;Nun wollen wir annehmen, die durch unsere Kritik nothwendig
gemachte Unterscheidung der Dinge, als Gegenstände der Erfahrung,
von eben denselben, als Dingen an sich selbst, wäre gar nicht
gemacht, so müsste der Grundsatz der Causalität und mithin der
Naturmechanismus in Bestimmung derselben durchaus von allen
Dingen überhaupt als wirkenden Ursachen gelten. Von eben
demselben Wesen also, z. B. der menschlichen Seele, würde ich nicht
sagen können, ihr Wille sei frei, und er sei doch zugleich der
Naturnothwendigkeit unterworfen, d. i. nicht frei, ohne in einen
offenbaren Widerspruch zu gerathen; weil ich die Seele in beiden
Sätzen in eben derselben Bedeutung, nämlich als Ding überhaupt
(als Sache an sich selbst), genommen habe und, ohne vorhergehende
Kritik, auch nicht anders nehmen konnte. Wenn aber die Kritik
nicht geirrt hat, da sie das Object in zweierlei Bedeutung nehmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
lehrt, nämlich als Erscheinung, oder als Ding an sich selbst; wenn
die Deduction ihrer Verstandesbegriffe richtig ist, mithin auch der
Grundsatz der Causalität nur auf Dinge im ersten Sinne genommen,
nämlich so fern sie Gegenstände der Erfahrung sind, geht, eben
dieselben aber nach der zweiten Bedeutung ihm nicht unterworfen
sind, so wird eben derselbe Wille in der Erscheinung (den sichtbaren
Handlungen) als dem Naturgesetze nothwendig gemäss und
so fern nicht frei, und doch andererseits, als einem Dinge an sich
selbst angehörig, jenem nicht unterworfen, mithin als frei gedacht,
ohne dass hiebei ein Widerspruch vorgeht.&rsquo; <i>Kritik der reinen
Vernunft</i>, in <i>Kant's Werke</i>, vol. ii. p. 24. &lsquo;Und hier zeigt die zwar
gemeine, aber betrügliche Voraussetzung der absoluten Realität der
Erscheinungen sogleich ihren nachtheiligen Einfluss, die Vernunft zu
verwirren. Denn sind Erscheinungen Dinge an sich selbst, so ist
Freiheit nicht zu retten. Alsdann ist Natur die vollständige und
an sich hinreichend bestimmende Ursache jeder Begebenheit, und
die Bedingung derselben ist jederzeit nur in der Reihe der Erscheinungen
enthalten, die sammt ihrer Wirkung unter dem Naturgesetze
nothwendig sind. Wenn dagegen Erscheinungen für Nichts
mehr gelten, als sie in der That sind, nämlich nicht für Dinge an
sich, sondern blosse Vorstellungen, die nach empirischen Gesetzen
zusammenhängen, so müssen sie selbst noch Gründe haben, die nicht
Erscheinungen sind.&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Hier habe ich nur die Anmerkung
machen wollen, dass, da der durchgängige Zusammenhang
aller Erscheinungen in einem Context der Natur ein unnachlässliches
Gesetz ist, dieses alle Freiheit nothwendig umstürzen müsste, wenn
man der Realität der Erscheinungen hartnäckig anhängen wollte.
Daher auch diejenigen, welche hierin der gemeinen Meinung folgen,
niemals dahin haben gelangen können, Natur und Freiheit mit
einander zu vereinigen.&rsquo; <i>Kritik</i>, in <i>Werke</i>, vol. ii. pp. 419, 420.
Finally, at p. 433, &lsquo;Man muss wohl bemerken, dass wir hiedurch
nicht die Wirklichkeit der Freiheit, als eines der Vermögen, welche
die Ursache von den Erscheinungen unserer Sinnenwelt enthalten,
haben darthun wollen. Denn ausser dass dieses gar keine transcendentale
Betrachtung, die bloss mit Begriffen zu thun hat, gewesen
sein würde, so könnte es auch nicht gelingen, indem wir aus der
Erfahrung niemals auf Etwas, was gar nicht nach Erfahrungsgesetzen
gedacht werden muss, schliessen können. Ferner haben wir auch
gar nicht einmal die Möglichkeit der Freiheit beweisen wollen;
denn dieses wäre auch nicht gelungen, weil wir überhaupt von
keinem Realgrunde und keiner Causalität aus blossen Begriffen <i>a
priori</i> die Möglichkeit erkennen können. Die Freiheit wird hier
nur als transcendentale Idee behandelt, wodurch die Vernunft die
Reihe der Bedingungen in der Erscheinung durch das sinnlich
Unbedingte schlechthin aufzuheben denkt, dabei sich in eine Antinomie
mit ihren eigenen Gesetzen, welche sie dem empirischen
Gebrauche des Verstandes vorschreibt, verwickelt. Dass nun diese
Antinomie auf einem blossen Scheine beruhe, und dass Natur der
Causalität aus Freiheit wenigstens nicht widerstreite, das war das<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Einzige, was wir leisten konnten, und woran es uns auch einzig und
allein gelegen war.&rsquo;</p>

<p>These passages prove that Kant saw that the phenomenal reality
of Free Will is an indefensible doctrine: and as the present work is
an investigation of the laws of phenomena, his transcendental philosophy
does not affect my conclusions. According to Kant's view
(and with which I am inclined to agree) the ordinary metaphysical
and theological treatment of this dark problem is purely empirical,
and therefore has no value. The denial of the supremacy of consciousness
follows as a natural consequence, and is the result of the
Kantian philosophy, and not, as is often said, the base of it.</p>

shall endeavour to prove in the next chapter, the immense importance of
the physical phenomena which precede and often control the metaphysical.
In the history of the Greek mind we can distinctly trace the passage
from physical to metaphysical inquiries. See <i>Grote's History of
Greece</i>, vol. iv. p. 519, edit. 1847. That the atomic doctrine, in its
relation to chance, was a natural precursor of Platonism, is remarked in
<i>Broussais</i>, <i>Examen des Doctrines Médicales</i>, vol. i. pp. 53, 54, an
able though one-sided work. Compare, respecting the Chance of the
atomists, <i>Ritter's History of Ancient Philosophy</i>, vol. i. p. 553; an
hypothesis, as Ritter says, &lsquo;destructive of all inner energy;&rsquo;
consequently antagonistic to the psychological hypothesis which
subsequently sprang up and conquered it. That physical researches came
first, is moreover attested by Diogenes Laertius:

ordinary methods of reasoning, not only oppose but exclude each other,
would be universally admitted if it were not for a desire generally felt
to save certain parts of each: it being thought dangerous to give up
free will on account of weakening moral responsibility, and equally
dangerous to give up predestination on account of impugning the power of
God. Various attempts have therefore been made to reconcile liberty with
necessity, and make the freedom of man harmonize with the foreknowledge
of the Deity. Compare on this point a remarkable letter from Locke to
Molyneux (<i>Locke's Works</i>, vol. viii. p. 305), with the argument in one
of Bentley's Sermons (<i>Monk's Life of Bentley</i>, vol. ii. pp. 7, 8); also

172) says that consciousness and belief are the same, and that great
error has arisen from calling &lsquo;consciousness a feeling distinct from all
other feelings.&rsquo; According to Locke (<i>Essay concerning Human
Understanding</i>, book ii. chap. i., Works, vol. i. p. 89), &lsquo;consciousness
is the perception of what passes in a man's own mind.&rsquo; Brown
(<i>Philosophy of the Mind</i>, pp. 67, 68) denies that consciousness is a
faculty: and Sir W. Hamilton complains of &lsquo;Reid's degradation of
consciousness into a special faculty.&rsquo; <i>Notes to Reid's Works</i>, pp. 223,
297, 373. M. Cousin (<i>Hist. de la Philosophie</i>, II. Série, vol. i. p.
131) pronounces consciousness to be &lsquo;phénomène complexe;&rsquo; and at p. 94,
&lsquo;la <i>condition</i> nécessaire de l'intelligence c'est la conscience:&rsquo; while
a still later writer (<i>Jobert's New System of Philosophy</i>, vol. i. p.
25) declares that &lsquo;we have the consciousness of our consciousness&mdash;this
is certain.&rsquo; The statement in Alciphron, Dialogue vii. (<i>Berkeley's
Works</i>, vol. i. pp. 505, 506) is equally unsatisfactory: and what still
further perplexes the question is the existence of what is now
recognised as &lsquo;double consciousness.&rsquo; See on this extraordinary
phenomenon <i>Elliotson's Physiology</i>, pp. 367&ndash;369, 1165; <i>Mayo's
Physiology</i>, pp. 195, 196; <i>Prichard's Treatise on Insanity</i>, pp. 450,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> This requires explanation. Consciousness is infallible as
to the <i>fact</i> of its testimony; but fallible as to the <i>truth</i>. That we
are conscious of certain phenomena, is a proof that those phenomena
exist in the mind, or are presented to it; but to say that this
demonstrates the truth of the phenomena is to go a step further, and not
only offer a testimony, but also pass a judgment. The moment we do this,
we introduce the element of fallibility; because consciousness and
judgment put together cannot be always right, inasmuch as judgment is
often wrong.</p>

<p>The late Blanco White, a thinker of considerable subtlety, says: &lsquo;The
important distinction between <i>libertas a necessitate</i> and <i>libertas a
coactione</i>, is seldom attended to. Nothing whatever can <i>force</i> my will:
every man is more or less conscious of that fact: but at the same time
we are, or may be, equally conscious that we are never decided without a
motive.&rsquo; <i>Life of B. White</i>, by Himself, 1845, vol. iii. p. 90. But how
can a man be conscious &lsquo;that nothing whatever <i>can</i> force his will&rsquo;?
This is not consciousness, but judgment: it is a judgment of what may
be, not a consciousness of what is. If there is any meaning in the word
&lsquo;consciousness,&rsquo; it must refer solely to the present, and can never
include future contingencies as to what <i>may</i> be or <i>can</i> be.</p></div>

standard in the human mind whereby we may test the truth or falsehood of
spectral phenomena and dreams. And the only conclusion to which this
consummate thinker could arrive, was that whatever appears true to the
individual mind is true for him: which, however, is an evasion of the
problem, not a solution of it. See the Theætetus, where Plato, as usual,
puts his own speculations into the mouth of Socrates. He opens the
question at the beginning of sec. 39 (<i>Platonis Opera</i>, vol. iii. p. 426,

discussing them, and entangling Theætetus in a maze, sums up at the end

mind, and exerting itself independently of motives. If any one says that
we have this power of acting without motives, but that in the practical
exercise of the power we are always guided by motives either conscious
or unconscious&mdash;if any one says this, he asserts a barren proposition,
which does not interfere with my views, and which may or may not be
true, but which most assuredly no one has ever yet succeeded in
proving.</p></div>

the understanding, and estimated by the ordinary logic with which the
understanding is conversant. But Kant has made a most remarkable attempt
to avoid the practical consequences of this, by asserting that freedom,
being an idea produced by the reason, must be referred to transcendental
laws of the reason; that is, to laws which are removed from the domain
of experience, and cannot be verified by observation. In regard,
however, to the scientific conceptions of the understanding (as
distinguished from the Reason) he fully admits the existence of a
Necessity destructive of Liberty. In Note A, at the end of this chapter,
I shall put together the most important passages in which Kant unfolds
this view.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> This is, of course, an hypothetical case, merely given as
an illustration. We never can know the whole of any man's antecedents,
or even the whole of our own; but it is certain that the nearer we
approach to a complete knowledge of the antecedent, the more likely we
shall be to predict the consequent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The doctrine of providential interference is bound up with
that of predestination, because the Deity, foreseeing all things, must
have foreseen His own intention to interfere. To deny this foresight, is
to limit the omniscience of God. Those, therefore, who hold that, in
particular cases, a special providence interrupts the ordinary course of
events, must also hold that in each case the interruption had been
predestined; otherwise they impeach one of the Divine attributes. For,
as Thomas Aquinas puts it (<i>Neander's History of the Church</i>, vol. viii.
p. 176), &lsquo;knowledge, as knowledge, does not imply, indeed, causality;
but in so far as it is a knowledge belonging to the artist who forms, it
stands in the relation of causality to that which is produced by his
art.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The same argument is stated by Alciphron, though not quite so
conclusively; <i>Dialogue</i> vii. sec. 20 in <i>Berkeley's Works</i>, vol. i. p.
515: and as to the impossibility of Omniscience having new knowledge or
an afterthought, see <i>Hitchcock's Religion of Geology</i>, 1851, pp. 267,
328; an ingenious work, but one which leaves all the real difficulties
untouched. Compare <i>Ritter's Hist. of Ancient Philos.</i> vol. iv. pp. 326,
327, with <i>Tennemann</i>, <i>Gesch. der Philos.</i> vol. vi. pp. 151, 342&ndash;345,
vol. ix. pp. 81&ndash;94, vol. xi. p. 178; and in particular, the question
raised (vol. viii. p. 242), &lsquo;Ob das Vorherwissen Gottes die Ursache der
künftigen Dinge sey, oder nicht.&rsquo; It was to meet all this, that some
asserted the eternity of matter, and others the existence of two
original principles, one good and one evil. <i>Beausobre</i>, <i>Histoire de
Manichée</i>, vol. ii. pp. 145, 146, 252, 336.</p></div>

actions, which they call indifferent, as belonging neither to virtue nor
to vice; and hence there arose the famous doctrine of probability, set
up by several eminent Romish casuists, and hotly attacked by Pascal. But
this, if we put aside its worst feature, namely its practical bearings,
is merely a question of definition; inasmuch as every indifferent act
must lean on the side either of evil or of good, and may therefore be
referred to the category to which it inclines; and certainly every
increase of vice diminishes virtue relatively, though not always
absolutely. Among the Greek philosophers there was a
schism on this point: &#7945;&#961;&#8051;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953; &#948;&#8050; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8054;&#962; (i.e. the Stoics)

subjects must be aware of the way in which writers on morals repeat the
commonplace and hackneyed notions of their predecessors; so that a man,
after reading everything that has been written on moral conduct and
moral philosophy, will find himself nearly as much in the dark as when
his studies first began. The most accurate investigators of the human
mind have hitherto been the poets, particularly Homer and Shakespeare;
but these extraordinary observers mainly occupied themselves with the
concrete phenomena of life; and if they analyzed, as they probably did,
they have concealed the steps of the process, so that now we can only
verify their conclusions empirically. The great advance made by the
statisticians consists in applying to these inquiries the doctrine of
averages, which no one thought of doing before the eighteenth century.</p></div>

in his observations on criminal law in <i>Appendix to Jefferson's Memoirs,

i. pp. 389, 390) found that the English Government had vainly attempted
to check the suicides frequently committed at Benares by drowning: and
in our country the interference of legislators is met by the perjury of
jurors, since, as Bentham says, English juries do not hesitate to
violate their oaths by declaring the suicide to be <i>non compos</i>.

and the impossibility of baffling his intention, there are cases
recorded of persons who, being deprived of the ordinary means of
destruction, put an end to life by holding their breath; while others
effected their purpose by turning back the tongue so as to exclude air
from the larynx. <i>Elliotson's Human Physiology</i>, pp. 491, 492.</p></div>

relations, and having no existence except in the mind, is essentially
intangible; and therefore, however small the law may be, it can never
admit of exceptions, though its operation may admit of innumerable
exceptions. Hence, as Dugald Stewart (<i>Philosophy of the Mind</i>, vol. ii.
p. 211) rightly says, we can only refer to the laws of nature &lsquo;by a sort
of figure or metaphor.&rsquo; This is constantly lost sight of even by authors
of repute; some of whom speak of laws as if they were causes, and
therefore liable to interruption by larger causes; while other writers
pronounce them to be &lsquo;delegated agencies&rsquo; from the Deity. Compare

Mr. Paget, in his able work, <i>Lectures on Pathology</i>, vol. i. p. 481,
vol. ii. p. 542, with much greater accuracy calls such cases &lsquo;apparent
exceptions&rsquo; to laws; but it would be better to say, &lsquo;exceptions to the
operations of laws.&rsquo; The context clearly proves that Mr. Paget

given of the possibility of arriving at certain constants with regard to

greatest variation which has taken place during the last three years, in
the proportion of any class of criminals at the same period of life, has
not exceeded a half per cent.&rsquo; See also <i>Report of British Association
for 1839, Transac. of Sec.</i>, p. 118. Indeed, all writers who have
examined the evidence are forced to admit this regularity, however they
may wish to explain it. M. Dufau (<i>Traité de Statistique</i>, p. 144) says,
&lsquo;Les faits de l'ordre moral sont, aussi bien que ceux de l'ordre
naturel, le produit de causes constantes et régulières,&rsquo; &amp;c.; and at p.
367, &lsquo;C'est ainsi que le monde moral se présente à nous, de ce point de

was a man of slender powers, and did not at all understand the real

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY PHYSICAL LAWS OVER THE ORGANIZATION
OF SOCIETY AND OVER THE CHARACTER OF INDIVIDUALS.</div>

<p>If we inquire what those physical agents are by which
the human race is most powerfully influenced, we shall
find that they may be classed under four heads: namely,
Climate, Food, Soil, and the General Aspect of Nature;
by which last, I mean those appearances which, though
presented chiefly to the sight, have, through the medium
of that or other senses, directed the association of
ideas, and hence in different countries have given rise
to different habits of national thought. To one of these
four classes, may be referred all the external phenomena
by which Man has been permanently affected. The
last of these classes, or what I call the General Aspect
of Nature, produces its principal results by exciting the
imagination, and by suggesting those innumerable
superstitions which are the great obstacles to advancing
knowledge. And as, in the infancy of a people, the
power of such superstitions is supreme, it has happened
that the various Aspects of Nature have caused corresponding
varieties in the popular character, and have
imparted to the national religion peculiarities which,
under certain circumstances, it is impossible to efface.
The other three agents, namely, Climate, Food, and
Soil, have, so far as we are aware, had no direct influence
of this sort; but they have, as I am about to
prove, originated the most important consequences in
regard to the general organization of society, and from
them there have followed many of those large and conspicuous
differences between nations, which are often
ascribed to some fundamental difference in the various
races into which mankind is divided. But while such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
original distinctions of race are altogether hypothetical,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
the discrepancies which are caused by difference of
climate, food, and soil, are capable of a satisfactory
explanation, and, when understood, will be found to
clear up many of the difficulties which still obscure the
study of history. I purpose, therefore, in the first
place, to examine the laws of these three vast agents
in so far as they are connected with Man in his social
condition; and having traced the working of those
laws with as much precision as the present state of
physical knowledge will allow, I shall then examine
the remaining agent, namely, the General Aspect of
Nature, and shall endeavour to point out the most important
divergencies to which its variations have, in
different countries, naturally given rise.</p>

<p>Beginning, then, with climate, food, and soil, it is
evident that these three physical powers are in no
small degree dependent on each other: that is to say,
there is a very close connexion between the climate of
a country and the food which will ordinarily be grown
in that country; while at the same time the food is
itself influenced by the soil which produces it, as also
by the elevation or depression of the land, by the state
of the atmosphere, and, in a word, by all those conditions
to the assemblage of which the name of Physical
Geography is, in its largest sense, commonly given.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The union between these physical agents being thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
intimate, it seems advisable to consider them not under
their own separate heads, but rather under the separate
heads of the effects produced by their united action.
In this way we shall rise at once to a more comprehensive
view of the whole question; we shall avoid the
confusion that would be caused by artificially separating
phenomena which are in themselves inseparable; and
we shall be able to see more clearly the extent of that
remarkable influence, which, in an early stage of
society, the powers of Nature exercise over the fortunes
of Man.</p>

<p>Of all the results which are produced among a people
by their climate, food, and soil, the accumulation of
wealth is the earliest, and in many respects the most
important. For although the progress of knowledge
eventually accelerates the increase of wealth, it is
nevertheless certain that, in the first formation of
society, the wealth must accumulate before the knowledge
can begin. As long as every man is engaged in
collecting the materials necessary for his own subsistence,
there will be neither leisure nor taste for higher
pursuits; no science can possibly be created, and the
utmost that can be effected will be an attempt to
economise labour by the contrivance of such rude and
imperfect instruments as even the most barbarous
people are able to invent.</p>

<p>In a state of society like this, the accumulation of
wealth is the first great step that can be taken, because
without wealth there can be no leisure, and without
leisure there can be no knowledge. If what a people
consume is always exactly equal to what they possess,
there will be no residue, and therefore, no capital being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
accumulated, there will be no means by which the
unemployed classes may be maintained.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But if the
produce is greater than the consumption, an overplus
arises, which, according to well-known principles, increases
itself, and eventually becomes a fund out of
which, immediately or remotely, every one is supported
who does not create the wealth upon which he lives.
And now it is that the existence of an intellectual class
first becomes possible, because for the first time there
exists a previous accumulation, by means of which men
can use what they did not produce, and are thus enabled
to devote themselves to subjects for which at an
earlier period the pressure of their daily wants would
have left them no time.</p>

<p>Thus it is that of all the great social improvements
the accumulation of wealth must be the first, because
without it there can be neither taste nor leisure for that
acquisition of knowledge on which, as I shall hereafter
prove, the progress of civilization depends. Now, it is
evident that among an entirely ignorant people, the
rapidity with which wealth is created will be solely
regulated by the physical peculiarities of their country.
At a later period, and when the wealth has been
capitalized, other causes come into play; but until this
occurs, the progress can only depend on two circumstances:
first on the energy and regularity with which
labour is conducted, and secondly on the returns made
to that labour by the bounty of nature. And these two
causes are themselves the result of physical antecedents.
The returns made to labour are governed by the fertility
of the soil, which is itself regulated partly by the
admixture of its chemical components, partly by the
extent to which, from rivers or from other natural
causes, the soil is irrigated, and partly by the heat and
humidity of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the
energy and regularity with which labour is conducted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
will be entirely dependent on the influence of climate.
This will display itself in two different ways. The
first, which is a very obvious consideration, is, that if
the heat is intense, men will be indisposed, and in some
degree unfitted, for that active industry which in a
milder climate they might willingly have exerted. The
other consideration, which has been less noticed, but is
equally important, is, that climate influences labour not
only by enervating the labourer or by invigorating him,
but also by the effect it produces on the regularity of
his habits.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Thus we find that no people living in a
very northern latitude have ever possessed that steady
and unflinching industry for which the inhabitants of
temperate regions are remarkable. The reason of this
becomes clear, when we remember that in the more
northern countries the severity of the weather, and, at
some seasons, the deficiency of light, render it impossible
for the people to continue their usual out-of-door
employments. The result is, that the working classes
being compelled to cease from their ordinary pursuits,
are rendered more prone to desultory habits; the
chain of their industry is as it were broken, and they
lose that impetus which long-continued and uninterrupted
practice never fails to give. Hence there arises
a national character more fitful and capricious than
that possessed by a people whose climate permits the
regular exercise of their ordinary industry. Indeed, so
powerful is this principle, that we may perceive its
operation even under the most opposite circumstances.
It would be difficult to conceive a greater difference in
government, laws, religion, and manners, than that
which distinguishes Sweden and Norway on the one
hand, from Spain and Portugal on the other. But
these four countries have one great point in common.
In all of them, continued agricultural industry is impracticable.
In the two southern countries, labour is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
interrupted by the heat, by the dryness of the weather,
and by the consequent state of the soil. In the two
northern countries, the same effect is produced by the
severity of the winter and the shortness of the days.
The consequence is, that these four nations, though so
different in other respects, are all remarkable for a
certain instability and fickleness of character; presenting
a striking contrast to the more regular and
settled habits which are established in countries
whose climate subjects the working classes to fewer
interruptions, and imposes on them the necessity of a
more constant and unremitting employment.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>These are the great physical causes by which the
creation of wealth is governed. There are, no doubt,
other circumstances which operate with considerable
force, and which, in a more advanced state of society,
possess an equal, and sometimes a superior, influence.
But this is at a later period; and looking at the history
of wealth in its earliest stage, it will be found to depend
entirely on soil and climate: the soil regulating the
returns made to any given amount of labour; the
climate regulating the energy and constancy of the
labour itself. It requires but a hasty glance at past
events, to prove the immense power of these two great
physical conditions. For there is no instance in history
of any country being civilized by its own efforts, unless
it has possessed one of these conditions in a very
favourable form. In Asia, civilization has always been
confined to that vast tract where a rich and alluvial
soil has secured to man that wealth without some share
of which no intellectual progress can begin. This great
region extends, with a few interruptions, from the east
of Southern China to the western coasts of Asia Minor,
of Ph&oelig;nicia, and of Palestine. To the north of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
immense belt, there is a long line of barren country
which has invariably been peopled by rude and
wandering tribes, who are kept in poverty by the ungenial
nature of the soil, and who, as long as they
remained on it, have never emerged from their uncivilized
state. How entirely this depends on physical
causes, is evident from the fact that these same Mongolian
and Tartarian hordes have, at different periods,
founded great monarchies in China, in India, and in
Persia, and have, on all such occasions, attained a
civilization nowise inferior to that possessed by the
most nourishing of the ancient kingdoms. For in the
fertile plains of Southern Asia,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> nature has supplied all
the materials of wealth; and there it was that these
barbarous tribes acquired for the first time some degree
of refinement, produced a national literature, and organized
a national polity; none of which things they,
in their native land, had been able to effect.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In the
same way, the Arabs in their own country have, owing
to the extreme aridity of their soil,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> always been a rude
and uncultivated people; for in their case, as in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
others, great ignorance is the fruit of great poverty.
But in the seventh century they conquered Persia;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
in the eighth century they conquered the best part of
Spain;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> in the ninth century they conquered the
Punjaub, and eventually nearly the whole of India.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Scarcely were they established in their fresh settlements,
when their character seemed to undergo a great change.
They, who in their original land were little else than
roving savages, were now for the first time able to accumulate
wealth, and, therefore, for the first time did
they make some progress in the arts of civilization. In
Arabia they had been a mere race of wandering shepherds;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
in their new abodes they became the founders
of mighty empires&mdash;they built cities, endowed schools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
collected libraries; and the traces of their power are
still to be seen at Cordova, at Bagdad, and at Delhi.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
Precisely in the same manner, there is adjoining Arabia
at the north, and only separated from it elsewhere by
the narrow waters of the Red Sea, an immense sandy
plain, which, covering the whole of Africa in the same
latitude, extends westward until it reaches the shores
of the Atlantic.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> This enormous tract is, like Arabia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
a barren waste;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and therefore, as in Arabia, the inhabitants
have always been entirely uncivilized,
acquiring no knowledge, simply because they have
accumulated no wealth.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> But this great desert is, in
its eastern part, irrigated by the waters of the Nile, the
overflowing of which covers the sand with a rich
alluvial deposit, that yields to labour the most abundant,
and indeed the most extraordinary, returns.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
The consequence is, that in that spot, wealth was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
rapidly accumulated, the cultivation of knowledge
quickly followed, and this narrow strip of land<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> became
the seat of Egyptian civilization; a civilization which,
though grossly exaggerated,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> forms a striking contrast
to the barbarism of the other nations of Africa, none of
which have been able to work out their own progress,
or emerge, in any degree, from the ignorance to which
the penury of nature has doomed them.</p>

<p>These considerations clearly prove that of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
primary causes of civilization, the fertility of the soil
is the one which in the ancient world exercised most
influence. But in European civilization, the other
great cause, that is to say, climate, has been the most
powerful; and this, as we have seen, produces an effect
partly on the capacity of the labourer for work, partly
on the regularity or irregularity of his habits. The
difference in the result has curiously corresponded with
the difference in the cause. For, although all civilization
must have for its antecedent the accumulation of
wealth, still what subsequently occurs will be in no
small degree determined by the conditions under which
the accumulation took place. In Asia, and in Africa,
the condition was a fertile soil, causing an abundant
return; in Europe, it was a happier climate, causing
more successful labour. In the former case, the effect
depends on the relation between the soil and its
produce; in other words, the mere operation of one
part of external nature upon another. In the latter
case, the effect depends on the relation between the
climate and the labourer; that is, the operation of
external nature not upon itself, but upon man. Of
these two classes of relations, the first, being the less
complicated, is the less liable to disturbance, and therefore
came sooner into play. Hence it is, that, in the
march of civilization, the priority is unquestionably due
to the most fertile parts of Asia and Africa. But
although their civilization was the earliest, it was very
far, indeed, from being the best or most permanent.
Owing to circumstances which I shall presently state,
the only progress which is really effective depends, not
upon the bounty of nature, but upon the energy of
man. Therefore it is, that the civilization of Europe,
which, in its earliest stage, was governed by climate,
has shown a capacity of development unknown to
those civilizations which were originated by soil. For
the powers of nature, notwithstanding their apparent
magnitude, are limited and stationary; at all events,
we have not the slightest proof that they have ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
increased, or that they will ever be able to increase.
But the powers of man, so far as experience and
analogy can guide us, are unlimited; nor are we possessed
of any evidence which authorizes us to assign
even an imaginary boundary at which the human intellect
will, of necessity, be brought to a stand. And
as this power which the mind possesses of increasing
its own resources, is a peculiarity confined to man, and
one eminently distinguishing him from what is commonly
called external nature, it becomes evident that
the agency of climate, which gives him wealth by
stimulating his labour, is more favourable to his
ultimate progress than the agency of soil, which likewise
gives him wealth, but which does so, not by
exciting his energies, but by virtue of a mere physical
relation between the character of the soil and
the quantity or value of the produce that it almost
spontaneously affords.</p>

<p>Thus far as to the different ways in which climate
and soil affect the creation of wealth. But another
point of equal, or perhaps of superior, importance
remains behind. After the wealth has been created, a
question arises as to how it is to be distributed; that
is to say, what proportion is to go to the upper classes,
and what to the lower. In an advanced stage of
society, this depends upon several circumstances of
great complexity, and which it is not necessary here to
examine.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But in a very early stage of society, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
before its later and refined complications have begun,
it may, I think, be proved that the distribution of
wealth is, like its creation, governed entirely by
physical laws; and that those laws are moreover so
active as to have invariably kept a vast majority of the
inhabitants of the fairest portion of the globe in a condition
of constant and inextricable poverty. If this
can be demonstrated, the immense importance of such
laws is manifest. For since wealth is an undoubted
source of power, it is evident that, supposing other
things equal, an inquiry into the distribution of wealth
is an inquiry into the distribution of power, and, as
such, will throw great light on the origin of those
social and political inequalities, the play and opposition
of which form a considerable part of the history of
every civilized country.</p>

<p>If we take a general view of this subject, we may say
that after the creation and accumulation of wealth have
once fairly begun, it will be distributed among two
classes, those who labour, and those who do not labour;
the latter being, as a class, the more able, the former
the more numerous. The fund by which both classes
are supported is immediately created by the lower
class, whose physical energies are directed, combined,
and as it were economized, by the superior skill of the
upper class. The reward of the workmen is called
their wages; the reward of the contrivers is called
their profits. At a later period, there will arise what
may be called the saving class; that is, a body of men
who neither contrive nor work, but lend their accumulations
to those who contrive, and in return for the
loan, receive a part of that reward which belongs to
the contriving class. In this case, the members of the
saving class are rewarded for their abstinence in
refraining from spending their accumulations, and this
reward is termed the interest of their money; so that
there is made a threefold division&mdash;Interest, Profits,
and Wages. But this is a subsequent arrangement,
which can only take place to any extent when wealth
has been considerably accumulated; and in the stage
of society we are now considering, this third, or saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
class, can hardly be said to have a separate existence.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
For our present purpose, therefore, it is enough to
ascertain what those natural laws are, which, as soon as
wealth is accumulated, regulate the proportion in
which it is distributed to the two classes of labourers
and employers.</p>

<p>Now, it is evident that wages being the price paid
for labour, the rate of wages must, like the price of all
other commodities, vary according to the changes in
the market. If the supply of labourers outstrips the
demand, wages will fall; if the demand exceeds the
supply, they will rise. Supposing, therefore, that in
any country there is a given amount of wealth to be
divided between employers and workmen, every increase
in the number of the workmen will tend to lessen the
average reward each can receive. And if we set aside
those disturbing causes by which all general views are
affected, it will be found that, in the long-run, the
question of wages is a question of population; for
although the total sum of the wages actually paid
depends upon the largeness of the fund from which
they are drawn, still the amount of wages received by
each man must diminish as the claimants increase,
unless, owing to other circumstances, the fund itself
should so advance as to keep pace with the greater
demands made upon it.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>To know the circumstances most favourable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
increase of what may be termed the wages-fund is a
matter of great moment, but is one with which we are
not immediately concerned. The question we have
now before us, regards not the accumulation of wealth,
but its distribution; and the object is, to ascertain
what those physical conditions are, which, by encouraging
a rapid growth of population, over-supply the
labour market, and thus keep the average rate of wages
at a very low point.</p>

<p>Of all the physical agents by which the increase of
the labouring classes is affected, that of food is the most
active and universal. If two countries, equal in all
other respects, differ solely in this&mdash;that in one the
national food is cheap and abundant, and in the other
scarce and dear, the population of the former country
will inevitably increase more rapidly than the population
of the latter.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> And, by a parity of reasoning,
the average rate of wages will be lower in the former
than in the latter, simply because the labour-market
will be more amply stocked.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> An inquiry, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
into the physical laws on which the food of different
countries depends, is, for our present purpose, of the
greatest importance; and fortunately it is one respecting
which we are able, in the present state of chemistry
and physiology, to arrive at some precise and
definite conclusions.</p>

<p>The food consumed by man produces two, and only
two, effects necessary to his existence. These are, first
to supply him with that animal heat without which the
functions of life would stop; and secondly, to repair
the waste constantly taking place in his tissues, that is,
in the mechanism of his frame. For each of these
separate purposes there is a separate food. The temperature
of our body is kept up by substances which
contain no nitrogen, and are called non-azotized; the
incessant decay in our organism is repaired by what
are known as azotized substances, in which nitrogen is
always found.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In the former case, the carbon of non-azotized
food combines with the oxygen we take in,
and gives rise to that internal combustion by which
our animal heat is renewed. In the latter case, nitrogen
having little affinity for oxygen,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the nitrogenous or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
azotized food is, as it were, guarded against combustion;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
and being thus preserved, is able to perform
its duty of repairing the tissues, and supplying those
losses which the human organism constantly suffers in
the wear and tear of daily life.</p>

<p>These are the two great divisions of food;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and if
we inquire into the laws which regulate the relation
they bear to man, we shall find that in each division
the most important agent is climate. When men live
in a hot country, their animal heat is more easily kept
up than when they live in a cold one; therefore they
require a smaller amount of that non-azotized food, the
sole business of which is to maintain at a certain point
the temperature of the body. In the same way, they,
in the hot country, require a smaller amount of azotized
food, because on the whole their bodily exertions are
less frequent, and on that account the decay of their
tissues is less rapid.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Since, therefore, the inhabitants of hot climates do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in their natural and ordinary state, consume less food
than the inhabitants of cold ones, it inevitably follows
that, provided other things remain equal, the growth
of population will be more rapid in countries which are
hot than in those which are cold. For practical purposes,
it is immaterial whether the greater plenty of a
substance by which the people are fed arises from a
larger supply, or whether it arises from a smaller consumption.
When men eat less, the result will be just
the same as if they had more; because the same amount
of nutriment will go farther, and thus population will
gain a power of increasing more quickly than it could
do in a colder country, where, even if provisions were
equally abundant, they, owing to the climate, would be
sooner exhausted.</p>

<p>This is the first point of view in which the laws of
climate are, through the medium of food, connected
with the laws of population, and therefore with the
laws of the distribution of wealth. But there is also
another point of view, which follows the same line of
thought, and will be found to strengthen the argument
just stated. This is, that in cold countries, not only
are men compelled to eat more than in hot ones, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
their food is dearer, that is to say, to get it is more
difficult, and requires a greater expenditure of labour.
The reason of this I will state as briefly as possible,
without entering into any details beyond those which
are absolutely necessary for a right understanding of
this interesting subject.</p>

<p>The objects of food are, as we have seen, only two:
namely, to keep up the warmth of the body, and repair
the waste in the tissues.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Of these two objects, the
former is effected by the oxygen of the air entering our
lungs, and, as it travels through the system, combining
with the carbon which we take in our food.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
combination of oxygen and carbon never can occur
without producing a considerable amount of heat, and
it is in this way that the human frame is maintained at
its necessary temperature.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> By virtue of a law familiar
to chemists, carbon and oxygen, like all other
elements, will only unite in certain definite proportions;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
so that to keep up a healthy balance, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
needful that the food which contains the carbon should
vary according to the amount of oxygen taken in:
while it is equally needful that we should increase the
quantity of both of these constituents whenever a
greater external cold lowers the temperature of the
body. Now it is obvious that in a very cold climate,
this necessity of providing a nutriment more highly
carbonized will arise in two distinct ways. In the first
place, the air being denser, men imbibe at each inspiration
a greater volume of oxygen than they would do
in a climate where the air is rarefied by heat.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In the
second place, cold accelerates their respiration, and thus
obliging them to inhale more frequently than the inhabitants
of hot countries, increases the amount of oxygen
which they on an average take in.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> On both these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
grounds the consumption of oxygen becomes greater:
it is therefore requisite that the consumption of carbon
should also be greater; since by the union of these two
elements in certain definite proportions, the temperature
of the body and the balance of the human frame
can alone be maintained.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Proceeding from these chemical and physiological
principles, we arrive at the conclusion, that the colder
the country is in which a people live, the more highly
carbonized will be their food. And this, which is a
purely scientific inference, has been verified by actual
experiment. The inhabitants of the polar regions consume
large quantities of whale-oil and blubber; while
within the tropics such food would soon put an end to
life, and therefore the ordinary diet consists almost
entirely of fruit, rice, and other vegetables. Now it
has been ascertained by careful analysis, that in the
polar food there is an excess of carbon; in the tropical
food an excess of oxygen. Without entering into details,
which to the majority of readers would be distasteful,
it may be said generally, that the oils contain
about six times as much carbon as the fruits, and that
they have in them very little oxygen;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> while starch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
which is the most universal, and, in reference to nutrition,
the most important constituent in the vegetable
world,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> is nearly half oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The connexion between this circumstance and the
subject before us is highly curious: for it is a most
remarkable fact, and one to which I would call particular
attention, that owing to some more general law,
of which we are ignorant, highly carbonized food is
more costly than food in which comparatively little
carbon is found. The fruits of the earth, of which
oxygen is the most active principle, are very abundant;
they may be obtained without danger, and almost
without trouble. But that highly carbonized food,
which in a very cold climate is absolutely necessary to
life, is not produced in so facile and spontaneous a
manner. It is not, like vegetables, thrown up by the
soil; but it consists of the fat, the blubber, and the oil<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
of powerful and ferocious animals. To procure it, man
must incur great risk and expend great labour. And
although this is undoubtedly a contrast of extreme
cases, still it is evident that the nearer a people approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to either extremity, the more subject will they be to
the conditions by which that extremity is governed. It
is evident that, as a general rule, the colder a country is,
the more its food will be carbonized; the warmer it is,
the more its food will be oxidized.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> At the same time,
carbonized food, being chiefly drawn from the animal
world, is more difficult to obtain than oxidized food,
which is drawn from the vegetable world.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The result
has been that among nations where the coldness of
the climate renders a highly carbonized diet essential,
there is for the most part displayed, even in the infancy
of society, a bolder and more adventurous character,
than we find among those other nations whose ordinary
nutriment, being highly oxidized, is easily obtained,
and indeed is supplied to them, by the bounty of nature,
gratuitously and without a struggle.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> From this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
original divergence there follow many other consequences,
which, however, I am not now concerned to
trace; my present object being merely to point out how
this difference of food affects the proportion in which
wealth is distributed to the different classes.</p>

<p>The way in which this proportion is actually altered
has, I hope, been made clear by the preceding argument;
but it may be useful to recapitulate the facts on
which the argument is based. The facts, then, are
simply these. The rate of wages fluctuates with the
population; increasing when the labour-market is
under-supplied, diminishing when it is over-supplied.
The population itself, though affected by many other
circumstances, does undoubtedly fluctuate with the
supply of food; advancing when the supply is plentiful,
halting or receding when the supply is scanty. The
food essential to life is scarcer in cold countries than in
hot ones; and not only is it scarcer, but more of it is
required;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> so that on both grounds smaller encouragement
is given to the growth of that population from
whose ranks the labour-market is stocked. To express,
therefore, the conclusion in its simplest form, we may
say, that there is a strong and constant tendency in hot
countries for wages to be low, in cold countries for
them to be high.</p>

<p>Applying now this great principle to the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
course of history, we shall find proofs of its accuracy in
every direction. Indeed, there is not a single instance
to the contrary. In Asia, in Africa, and in America,
all the ancient civilizations were seated in hot climates;
and in all of them the rate of wages was very low, and
therefore the condition of the labouring classes very
depressed. In Europe, for the first time, civilization
arose in a colder climate: hence the reward of labour
was increased, and the distribution of wealth rendered
more equal than was possible in countries where an
excessive abundance of food stimulated the growth of
population. This difference produced, as we shall
presently see, many social and political consequences of
immense importance. But before discussing them, it
may be remarked that the only apparent exception to
what has been stated is one which strikingly verifies
the general law. There is one instance, and only one,
of a great European people possessing a very cheap
national food. This people, I need hardly say, are
the Irish. In Ireland the labouring classes have for
more than two hundred years been principally fed by
potatoes, which were introduced into their country late
in the sixteenth, or early in the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Now, the peculiarity of the potato is, that until the
appearance of the late disease, it was and perhaps still
is, cheaper than any other food equally wholesome. If
we compare its reproductive power with the amount of
nutriment contained in it, we find that one acre of
average land sown with potatoes will support twice
as many persons as the same quantity of land sown
with wheat.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The consequence is, that in a country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
where men live on potatoes, the population will, if other
things are tolerably equal, increase twice as fast as in
a country where they live on wheat. And so it has
actually occurred. Until a very few years ago, when
the face of affairs was entirely altered by pestilence and
emigration, the population of Ireland was, in round
numbers, increasing annually three per cent.; the
population of England during the same period increasing
one and a half per cent.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The result was, that in
these two countries the distribution of wealth was altogether
different. Even in England the growth of population
is somewhat too rapid; and the labour-market
being overstocked, the working classes are not sufficiently
paid for their labour.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> But their condition is
one of sumptuous splendour, compared to that in which
only a few years ago the Irish were forced to live.
The misery in which they were plunged has no doubt
always been aggravated by the ignorance of their
rulers, and by that scandalous misgovernment which,
until very recently, formed one of the darkest blots on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the glory of England. The most active cause, however,
was, that their wages were so low as to debar them,
not only from the comforts, but from the common
decencies of civilized life; and this evil condition was
the natural result of that cheap and abundant food,
which encouraged the people to so rapid an increase,
that the labour-market was constantly gorged.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> So
far was this carried, that an intelligent observer who
travelled through Ireland twenty years ago, mentioned
that at that time the average wages were fourpence a
day, and that even this wretched pittance could not
always be relied upon for regular employment.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Such have been the consequences of cheap food in a
country which, on the whole, possesses greater natural
resources than any other in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> And if we investigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
on a larger scale the social and economical condition
of nations, we shall see the same principle
everywhere at work. We shall see that, other things
remaining equal, the food of a people determines the
increase of their numbers, and the increase of their
numbers determines the rate of their wages. We shall
moreover find, that when the wages are invariably
low,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the distribution of wealth being thus very
unequal, the distribution of political power and social
influence will also be very unequal; in other words, it
will appear that the normal and average relation between
the upper and lower classes will, in its origin,
depend upon those peculiarities of nature, the operations
of which I have endeavoured to indicate.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
putting all these things together, we shall, I trust, be
able to discern, with a clearness hitherto unknown, the
intimate connexion between the physical and moral
world; the laws by which that connexion is governed;
and the reasons why so many ancient civilizations
reached a certain stage of development, and then fell
away, unable to resist the pressure of nature, or make
head against those external obstacles by which their
progress was effectually retarded.</p>

<p>If, in the first place, we turn to Asia, we shall see an
admirable illustration of what may be called the collision
between internal and external phenomena. Owing to
circumstances already stated, Asiatic civilization has
always been confined to that rich tract where alone
wealth could be easily obtained. This immense zone
comprises some of the most fertile parts of the globe;
and of all its provinces, Hindostan is certainly the one
which for the longest period has possessed the greatest
civilization.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> And as the materials for forming an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
opinion respecting India are more ample than those
respecting any other part of Asia,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> I purpose to select
it as an example, and use it to illustrate those laws
which, though generalized from political economy,
chemistry, and physiology, may be verified by that
more extensive survey, the means of which history
alone can supply.</p>

<p>In India, the great heat of the climate brings into
play that law already pointed out, by virtue of which
the ordinary food is of an oxygenous rather than of a
carbonaceous character. This, according to another
law, obliges the people to derive their usual diet not
from the animal, but from the vegetable world, of which
starch is the most important constituent. At the same
time the high temperature, incapacitating men for
arduous labour, makes necessary a food of which the
returns will be abundant, and which will contain much
nutriment in a comparatively small space. Here, then,
we have some characteristics, which, if the preceding
views are correct, ought to be found in the ordinary
food of the Indian nations. So they all are. From
the earliest period the most general food in India has
been rice,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> which is the most nutritive of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
cerealia;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> which contains an enormous proportion of
starch;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and which yields to the labourer an average
return of at least sixty fold.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Thus possible is it, by the application of a few physical
laws, to anticipate what the national food of a country
will be, and therefore to anticipate a long train of
ulterior consequences. What in this case is no less
remarkable, is that though in the south of the peninsula,
rice is not so much used as formerly, it has been replaced,
not by animal food, but by another grain called
ragi.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The original rice, however, is so suited to the
circumstances I have described, that it is still the most
general food of nearly all the hottest countries of Asia,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
from which at different times it has been transplanted
to other parts of the world.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of these peculiarities of climate, and
of food, there has arisen in India that unequal distribution
of wealth which we must expect to find in
countries where the labour-market is always redundant.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
If we examine the earliest Indian records
which have been preserved&mdash;records between two and
three thousand years old&mdash;we find evidence of a state
of things similar to that which now exists, and which,
we may rely upon it, always has existed ever since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
accumulation of capital once fairly began. We find
the upper classes enormously rich, and the lower classes
miserably poor. We find those by whose labour the
wealth is created, receiving the smallest possible share
of it; the remainder being absorbed by the higher
ranks in the form either of rent or of profit. And as
wealth is, after intellect, the most permanent source of
power, it has naturally happened that a great inequality
of wealth has been accompanied by a corresponding inequality
of social and political power. It is not, therefore,
surprising that from the earliest period to which
our knowledge of India extends, an immense majority
of the people, pinched by the most galling poverty, and
just living from hand to mouth, should always have
remained in a state of stupid debasement, broken by
incessant misfortune, crouching before their superiors
in abject submission, and only fit either to be slaves
themselves or to be led to battle to make slaves of
others.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>To ascertain the precise value of the average rate of
wages in India for any long period, is impossible; because,
although the amount might be expressed in
money, still the value of money, that is, its purchasing
power, is subject to incalculable fluctuations, arising
from changes in the cost of production.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> But, for our
present purpose, there is a method of investigation
which will lead to results far more accurate than any
statement could be that depended merely on a collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of evidence respecting the wages themselves. The
method is simply this: that inasmuch as the wealth of
a country can only be divided into wages, rent, profits,
and interest, and inasmuch as interest is on an average
an exact measure of profits,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> it follows that if among
any people rent and interest are both high, wages must
be low.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> If, therefore, we can ascertain the current
interest of money, and the proportion of the produce of
the soil which is absorbed by rent, we shall get a perfectly
accurate idea of the wages; because wages are
the residue, that is, they are what is left to the labourers
after rent, profits, and interest have been paid.</p>

<p>Now it is remarkable, that in India both interest and
rent have always been very high. In the <i>Institutes of
Menu</i>, which were drawn up about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 900,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the lowest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
legal interest for money is fixed at fifteen per cent., the
highest at sixty per cent.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Nor is this to be considered
as a mere ancient law now fallen into disuse. So far
from that, the <i>Institutes of Menu</i> are still the basis of
Indian jurisprudence;<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and we know on very good
authority, that in 1810 the interest paid for the use of
money varied from thirty-six to sixty per cent.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Thus much as to one of the elements of our present
calculation. As to the other element, namely, the rent,
we have information equally precise and trustworthy.
In England and Scotland, the rent paid by the cultivator
for the use of land is estimated in round numbers,
taking one farm with another, at a fourth of the gross
produce.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In France, the average proportion is about
a third;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> while in the United States of North America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
it is well known to be much less, and, indeed, in some
parts, to be merely nominal.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> But in India the legal
rent, that is, the lowest rate recognized by the law and
usage of the country, is one-half of the produce; and
even this cruel regulation is not strictly enforced, since
in many cases rents are raised so high, that the cultivator
not only receives less than half the produce, but
receives so little as to have scarcely the means of
providing seed to sow the ground for the next harvest.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion to be drawn from these facts is manifest.
Rent and interest being always very high, and
interest varying, as it must do, according to the rate of
profits, it is evident that wages must have been very
low; for since there was in India a specific amount of
wealth to be divided into rent, interest, profits, and
wages, it is clear that the first three could only have
been increased at the expense of the fourth; which is
saying, in other words, that the reward of the labourers
was very small in proportion to the reward received by
the upper classes. And though this, being an inevitable
inference, does not require extraneous support, it may
be mentioned that in modern times, for which alone we
have direct evidence, wages have in India always been
excessively low, and the people have been, and still are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
obliged to work for a sum barely sufficient to meet the
exigencies of life.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>This was the first great consequence induced in India
by the cheapness and abundance of the national food.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
But the evil by no means stopped there. In India, as
in every other country, poverty provokes contempt, and
wealth produces power. When other things are equal,
it must be with classes of men as with individuals, that
the richer they are, the greater the influence they will
possess. It was therefore to be expected, that the
unequal distribution of wealth should cause an unequal
distribution of power; and as there is no instance on
record of any class possessing power without abusing
it, we may easily understand how it was that the people
of India, condemned to poverty by the physical laws of
their climate, should have fallen into a degradation from
which they have never been able to escape. A few
instances may be given to illustrate, rather than to
prove, a principle which the preceding arguments have,
I trust, placed beyond the possibility of dispute.</p>

<p>To the great body of the Indian people the name of
Sudras is given;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and the native laws respecting them
contain some minute and curious provisions. If a
member of this despised class presumed to occupy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
same seat as his superiors, he was either to be exiled
or to suffer a painful and ignominious punishment.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
If he spoke of them with contempt, his mouth was to
be burned;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> if he actually insulted them, his tongue
was to be slit;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> if he molested a Brahmin, he was to
be put to death;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> if he sat on the same carpet with a
Brahmin, he was to be maimed for life;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> if, moved
by the desire of instruction, he even listened to the
reading of the sacred books, burning oil was to be
poured into his ears;<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> if, however, he committed them
to memory, he was to be killed;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> if he were guilty of
a crime, the punishment for it was greater than that
inflicted on his superiors;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> but if he himself were
murdered, the penalty was the same as for killing a
dog, a cat, or a crow.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Should he marry his daughter
to a Brahmin, no retribution that could be exacted in
this world was sufficient; it was therefore announced
that the Brahmin must go to hell, for having suffered
contamination from a woman immeasurably his inferior.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Indeed, it was ordered that the mere name
of a labourer should be expressive of contempt, so that
his proper standing might be immediately known.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
And lest this should not be enough to maintain the
subordination of society, a law was actually made forbidding
any labourer to accumulate wealth;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> while
another clause declared, that even though his master
should give him freedom, he would in reality still be a
slave; &lsquo;for,&rsquo; says the lawgiver&mdash;&lsquo;for of a state which
is natural to him, by whom can he be divested?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>By whom, indeed, could he be divested? I ween
not where that power was by which so vast a miracle
could be worked. For in India, slavery, abject, eternal
slavery, was the natural state of the great body of the
people; it was the state to which they were doomed
by physical laws utterly impossible to resist. The
energy of those laws is, in truth, so invincible, that
wherever they have come into play, they have kept
the productive classes in perpetual subjection. There
is no instance on record of any tropical country, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
which wealth having been extensively accumulated,
the people have escaped their fate; no instance in
which the heat of the climate has not caused an abundance
of food, and the abundance of food caused an
unequal distribution, first of wealth, and then of political
and social power. Among nations subjected to
these conditions, the people have counted for nothing;
they have had no voice in the management of the
state, no control over the wealth their own industry
created. Their only business has been to labour;
their only duty to obey. Thus there has been generated
among them, those habits of tame and servile
submission, by which, as we know from history, they
have always been characterized. For it is an undoubted
fact, that their annals furnish no instance
of their having turned upon their rulers, no war of
classes, no popular insurrections, not even one great
popular conspiracy. In those rich and fertile countries
there have been many changes, but all of them have
been from above, not from below. The democratic
element has been altogether wanting. There have
been in abundance, wars of kings, and wars of dynasties.
There have been revolutions in the government,
revolutions in the palace, revolutions on the throne;
but no revolutions among the people;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> no mitigation
of that hard lot which nature, rather than man, assigned
to them. Nor was it until civilization arose in
Europe, that other physical laws came into operation,
and therefore other results were produced. In Europe,
for the first time, there was some approach to equality,
some tendency to correct that enormous disproportion
of wealth and power, which formed the essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
weakness of the greatest of the more ancient countries.
As a natural consequence, it is in Europe that everything
worthy of the name of civilization has originated; because
there alone have attempts been made to preserve
the balance of its relative parts. There alone has
society been organized according to a scheme, not
indeed sufficiently large, but still wide enough to include
all the different classes of which it is composed,
and thus, by leaving room for the progress of each, to
secure the permanence and advancement of the whole.</p>

<p>The way in which certain other physical peculiarities
confined to Europe, have also accelerated the progress
of Man by diminishing his superstition, will be indicated
towards the end of this chapter; but as that will
involve an examination of some laws which I have not
yet noticed, it seems advisable, in the first place, to
complete the inquiry now before us; and I therefore
purpose proving that the line of argument which has
been just applied to India, is likewise applicable to
Egypt, to Mexico, and to Peru. For by thus including
in a single survey, the most conspicuous civilizations
of Asia, Africa, and America, we shall be able to see
how the preceding principles hold good of different
and distant countries; and we shall be possessed of
evidence sufficiently comprehensive to test the accuracy
of those great laws which, without such precaution,
I might be supposed to have generalized from
scanty and imperfect materials.</p>

<p>The reasons why, of all the African nations, the
Egyptians alone were civilized, have been already
stated, and have been shown to depend on those physical
peculiarities which distinguish them from the
surrounding countries, and which, by facilitating the
acquisition of wealth, not only supplied them with
material resources that otherwise they could never
have obtained, but also secured to their intellectual
classes the leisure and the opportunity of extending
the boundaries of knowledge. It is, indeed, true that,
notwithstanding these advantages, they effected nothing
of much moment; but this was owing to circumstances
which will be hereafter explained; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
must, at all events, be admitted that they raised themselves
far above every other people by whom Africa
was inhabited.</p>

<p>The civilization of Egypt being, like that of India,
caused by the fertility of the soil, and the climate
being also very hot,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> there were in both countries
brought into play the same laws; and there naturally
followed the same results. In both countries we find
the national food cheap and abundant: hence the
labour-market over-supplied; hence a very unequal
division of wealth and power; and hence all the consequences
which such inequality will inevitably produce.
How this system worked in India, I have just
attempted to examine; and although the materials for
studying the former condition of Egypt are much less
ample, they are still sufficiently numerous to prove the
striking analogy between the two civilizations, and the
identity of those great principles which regulated the
order of their social and political development.</p>

<p>If we inquire into the most important circumstances
which concerned the people of ancient Egypt, we shall
see that they are exactly the counterpart of those that
have been noticed in India. For, in the first place, as
regards their ordinary food, what rice is to the most
fertile parts of Asia, that are dates to Africa. The
palm-tree is found in every country from the Tigris
to the Atlantic;<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and it supplies millions of human
beings with their daily food in Arabia,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and in nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the whole of Africa north of the equator.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> In many
parts of the great African desert it is indeed unable
to bear fruit; but naturally it is a very hardy plant,
and produces dates in such profusion, that towards the
north of the Sahara they are eaten not only by man,
but also by domestic animals.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> And in Egypt, where
the palm is said to be of spontaneous growth,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> dates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
besides being the chief sustenance of the people, are so
plentiful, that from a very early period they have been
given commonly to camels, the only beasts of burden
generally used in that country.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>From these facts, it is evident that, taking Egypt as
the highest type of African civilization, and India as
the highest type of Asiatic civilization, it may be said
that dates are to the first civilization what rice is to the
second. Now it is observable, that all the most important
physical peculiarities found in rice are also
found in dates. In regard to their chemistry, it is well
known that the chief principle of the nutriment they
contain is the same in both; the starch of the Indian
vegetable being merely turned into the sugar of the
Egyptian. In regard to the laws of climate, their
affinity is equally obvious; since dates, like rice, belong
to hot countries, and flourish most in or near the
tropics.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> In regard to their increase, and the laws of
their connexion with the soil, the analogy is also exact;
for dates, just the same as rice, require little labour, and
yield abundant returns, while they occupy so small a
space of land in comparison with the nutriment they
afford, that upwards of two hundred palm-trees are
sometimes planted on a single acre.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Thus striking are the similarities to which, in different
countries, the same physical conditions naturally give
rise. At the same time, in Egypt, as in India, the
attainment of civilization was preceded by the possession
of a highly fertile soil; so that, while the exuberance
of the land regulated the speed with which wealth was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
created, the abundance of the food regulated the proportions
into which the wealth was divided. The most
fertile part of Egypt is the Said;<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and it is precisely
there that we find the greatest display of skill and
knowledge, the splendid remains of Thebes, Carnac,
Luxor, Dendera, and Edfou.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> It is also in the Said,
or as it is often called the Thebaid, that a food is used
which multiplies itself even more rapidly than either
dates or rice. This is the dhourra, which until recently
was confined to Upper Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and of which the
reproductive power is so remarkable, that it yields to
the labourer a return of two hundred and forty for
one.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In Lower Egypt the dhourra was formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
unknown; but, in addition to dates, the people made a
sort of bread from the lotos, which sprang spontaneously
out of the rich soil of the Nile.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> This must have
been a very cheap and accessible food; while to it there
was joined a profusion of other plants and herbs, on
which the Egyptians chiefly lived.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Indeed so inexhaustible
was the supply, that at the time of the
Mohammedan invasion there were, in the single city of
Alexandria, no less than four thousand persons occupied
in selling vegetables to the people.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>From this abundance of the national food, there resulted
a train of events strictly analogous to those which
took place in India. In Africa generally, the growth
of population, though on the one hand stimulated by
the heat of the climate, was on the other hand checked
by the poverty of the soil. But on the banks of the
Nile this restraint no longer existed,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the laws already noticed came into uncontrolled operation.
By virtue of those laws, the Egyptians were not
only satisfied with a cheap food, but they required that
food in comparatively small quantities; thus by a double
process, increasing the limit to which their numbers
could extend. At the same time the lower orders were
able to rear their offspring with the greater ease, because,
owing to the high rate of temperature, another
considerable source of expense was avoided; the heat
being such that, even for adults, the necessary clothes
were few and slight, while the children of the working
classes were entirely naked; affording a striking contrast
to those colder countries where, to preserve ordinary
health, a supply of warmer and more costly
covering is essential. Diodorus Siculus, who travelled
in Egypt nineteen centuries ago, says, that to bring up
a child to manhood did not cost more than twenty
drachmas, scarcely thirteen shillings English money;
a circumstance which he justly notices as a cause of
the populousness of the country.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>To compress into a single sentence the preceding
remarks, it may be said that in Egypt the people multiplied
rapidly, because while the soil increased their
supplies, the climate lessened their wants. The result
was, that Egypt was not only far more thickly peopled
than any other country in Africa, but probably more so
than any in the ancient world. Our information upon
this point is indeed somewhat scanty, but it is derived
from sources of unquestioned credibility. Herodotus,
who the more he is understood the more accurate he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
found to be,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> states that in the reign of Amasis there
were said to have been twenty thousand inhabited
cities.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> This may, perhaps, be considered an exaggeration;
but what is very observable is, that Diodorus
Siculus, who travelled in Egypt four centuries after
Herodotus, and whose jealousy of the reputation of his
great predecessor made him anxious to discredit his
statements,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> does nevertheless, on this important
point, confirm them. For he not only remarks that
Egypt was at that time as densely inhabited as any
existing country, but he adds, on the authority of
records which were then extant, that it was formerly
the most populous in the world, having contained, he
says, upwards of eighteen thousand cities.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>These were the only two ancient writers who, from
personal knowledge, were well acquainted with the
state of Egypt;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and their testimony is the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
valuable because it was evidently drawn from different
sources; the information of Herodotus being chiefly
collected at Memphis, that of Diodorus at Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
And whatever discrepancies there may be between
these two accounts, they are both agreed respecting the
rapid increase of the people, and the servile condition
into which they had fallen. Indeed, the mere appearance
of those huge and costly buildings, which are still
standing, are a proof of the state of the nation that
erected them. To raise structures so stupendous,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
and yet so useless,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> there must have been tyranny on
the part of the rulers, and slavery on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
people. No wealth, however great, no expenditure,
however lavish, could meet the expense which would
have been incurred, if they had been the work of free
men, who received for their labour a fair and honest
reward.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> But in Egypt, as in India, such considerations
were disregarded, because everything tended to
favour the upper ranks of society and depress the lower.
Between the two there was an immense and impassable
gap.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> If a member of the industrious classes changed
his usual employment, or was known to pay attention
to political matters, he was severely punished;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and
under no circumstances was the possession of land
allowed to an agricultural labourer, to a mechanic, or
indeed to any one except the king, the clergy, and the
army.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The people at large were little better than
beasts of burden; and all that was expected from them
was an unremitting and unrequited labour. If they
neglected their work, they were flogged; and the same
punishment was frequently inflicted upon domestic
servants, and even upon women.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> These and similar
regulations were well conceived; they were admirably
suited to that vast social system, which, because it was
based on despotism, could only be upheld by cruelty.
Hence it was that, the industry of the whole nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
being at the absolute command of a small part of it,
there arose the possibility of rearing those vast edifices,
which inconsiderate observers admire as a proof of
civilization,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> but which, in reality, are evidence of a
state of things altogether depraved and unhealthy; a
state in which the skill and the arts of an imperfect
refinement injured those whom they ought to have
benefited; so that the very resources which the people
had created were turned against the people themselves.</p>

<p>That in such a society as this, much regard should
be paid to human suffering, it would indeed be idle to
expect.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Still, we are startled by the reckless prodigality
with which, in Egypt, the upper classes squandered
away the labour and the lives of the people. In
this respect, as the monuments yet remaining abundantly
prove, they stand alone and without a rival. We
may form some idea of the almost incredible waste,
when we hear that two thousand men were occupied
for three years in carrying a single stone from Elephantine
to Sais;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> that the Canal of the Red Sea alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
cost the lives of a hundred and twenty thousand
Egyptians;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and that to build one of the pyramids
required the labour of three hundred and sixty thousand
men for twenty years.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>If, passing from the history of Asia and Africa, we
now turn to the New World, we shall meet with fresh
proof of the accuracy of the preceding views. The
only parts of America which before the arrival of the
Europeans were in some degree civilized, were Mexico
and Peru;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> to which may probably be added that
long and narrow tract which stretches from the south
of Mexico to the Isthmus of Panama. In this latter
country, which is now known as Central America, the
inhabitants, aided by the fertility of the soil,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> seem to
have worked out for themselves a certain amount of
knowledge; since the ruins still extant, prove the possession
of a mechanical and architectural skill too
considerable to be acquired by any nation entirely
barbarous.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Beyond this, nothing is known of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
history; but the accounts we have of such buildings as
Copan, Palenque, and Uxmal, make it highly probable
that Central America was the ancient seat of a civilization,
in all essential points similar to those of India
and Egypt; that is to say, similar to them in respect to
the unequal distribution of wealth and power, and the
thraldom in which the great body of the people consequently
remained.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>But although the evidence from which we might
estimate the former condition of Central America is
almost entirely lost,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> we are more fortunate in regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to the histories of Mexico and Peru. There are still
existing considerable and authentic materials, from
which we may form an opinion on the ancient state of
those two countries, and on the nature and extent of
their civilization. Before, however, entering upon this
subject, it will be convenient to point out what those
physical laws were which determined the localities of
American civilization; or, in other words, why it was
that in these countries alone, society should have been
organized into a fixed and settled system, while the
rest of the New World was peopled by wild and ignorant
barbarians. Such an inquiry will be found highly
interesting, as affording further proof of the extraordinary,
and indeed irresistible, force with which the
powers of nature have controlled the fortunes of man.</p>

<p>The first circumstance by which we must be struck,
is that in America, as in Asia and Africa, all the original
civilizations were seated in hot countries; the
whole of Peru proper being within the southern tropic,
the whole of Central America and Mexico within the
northern tropic. How the heat of the climate operated
on the social and political arrangements of India and
Egypt, I have attempted to examine; and it has, I
trust, been proved that the result was brought about
by diminishing the wants and requirements of the
people, and thus producing a very unequal distribution
of wealth and power. But, besides this, there is another
way in which the average temperature of a country
affects its civilization, and the discussion of which I
have reserved for the present moment, because it may
be more clearly illustrated in America than elsewhere.
Indeed, in the New World, the scale on which Nature
works, being much larger than in the Old, and her
forces being more overpowering, it is evident that her
operations on mankind may be studied with greater
advantage than in countries where she is weaker, and
where, therefore, the consequences of her movements
are less conspicuous.</p>

<p>If the reader will bear in mind the immense influence
which an abundant national food has been shown to
exercise, he will easily understand how, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
pressure of physical phenomena, the civilization of
America was, of necessity, confined to those parts where
alone it was found by the discoverers of the New
World. For, setting aside the chemical and geognostic
varieties of soil, it may be said that the two causes
which regulate the fertility of every country are heat
and moisture.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Where these are abundant, the land
will be exuberant; where they are deficient, it will be
sterile. This rule is, of course, in its application subject
to exceptions, arising from physical conditions
which are independent of it; but if other things are
equal, the rule is invariable. And the vast additions
which, since the construction of isothermal lines, have
been made to our knowledge of geographical botany,
enable us to lay this down as a law of nature, proved
not only by arguments drawn from vegetable physiology,
but also by a careful study of the proportions in
which plants are actually distributed in different countries.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>A general survey of the continent of America will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
illustrate the connexion between this law and the subject
now before us. In the first place, as regards
moisture, all the great rivers in the New World are on
the eastern coast, none of them on the western. The
causes of this remarkable fact are unknown;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> but it
is certain that neither in North, nor in South America,
does one considerable river empty itself into the Pacific;
while on the opposite side there are numerous rivers,
some of enormous magnitude, all of great importance,
as the Negro, the La Plata, the San Francisco, the
Amazon, the Orinoco, the Mississippi, the Alabama, the
Saint John, the Potomac, the Susquehannah, the Delaware,
the Hudson, and the Saint Lawrence. By this
vast water-system the soil is towards the east constantly
irrigated:<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> but towards the west there is in North
America only one river of value, the Oregon;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in South America, from the Isthmus of Panama to the
Straits of Magellan, there is no great river at all.</p>

<p>But as to the other main cause of fertility, namely
heat, we find in North America a state of things precisely
the reverse. There we find that while the irrigation
is on the east, the heat is on the west.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> This
difference of temperature between the two coasts is
probably connected with some great meteorological
law; for in the whole of the northern hemisphere, the
eastern part of continents and of islands is colder than
the western.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Whether, however, this is owing to
some large and comprehensive cause, or whether each
instance has a cause peculiar to itself, is an alternative,
in the present state of knowledge, impossible to decide;
but the fact is unquestionable, and its influence upon
the early history of America is extremely curious. In
consequence of it, the two great conditions of fertility
have not been united in any part of the continent north
of Mexico. The countries on the one side have wanted
heat; those on the other side have wanted irrigation.
The accumulation of wealth being thus impeded, the
progress of society was stopped; and until, in the sixteenth
century, the knowledge of Europe was brought
to bear upon America, there is no instance of any people
north of the twentieth parallel, reaching even that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
imperfect civilization to which the inhabitants of India
and of Egypt easily attained.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> On the other hand,
south of the twentieth parallel, the continent suddenly
changes its form, and, rapidly contracting, becomes a
small strip of land, until it reaches the Isthmus of
Panama. This narrow tract was the centre of Mexican
civilization; and a comparison of the preceding arguments
will easily show why such was the case; for the
peculiar configuration of the land secured a very large
amount of coast, and thus gave to the southern part of
North America the character of an island. Hence there
arose one of the characteristics of an insular climate,
namely, an increase of moisture caused by the watery
vapour which springs from the sea.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> While, therefore,
the position of Mexico near the equator gave it heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the shape of the land gave it humidity; and this being
the only part of North America in which these two
conditions were united, it was likewise the only part
which was at all civilized. There can be no doubt that
if the sandy plains of California and southern Columbia,
instead of being scorched into sterility, had been irrigated
by the rivers of the east, or if the rivers of the
east had been accompanied by the heat of the west, the
result of either combination would have been that
exuberance of soil by which, as the history of the world
decisively proves, every early civilization was preceded.
But inasmuch as, of the two elements of fertility, one
was deficient in every part of America north of the
twentieth parallel, it followed that, until that line was
passed, civilization could gain no resting-place; and
there never has been found, and we may confidently
assert never will be found, any evidence that even a
single ancient nation, in the whole of that enormous
continent, was able to make much progress in the arts
of life, or organize itself into a fixed and permanent
society.</p>

<p>Thus far as to the physical agents which controlled
the early destinies of North America. But in reference
to South America, a different train of circumstances
came into play; for the law by virtue of which
the eastern coasts are colder than the western, is not
only inapplicable to the southern hemisphere, but is
replaced by another law precisely the reverse. North
of the equator, the east is colder than the west; south
of the equator, the east is hotter than the west.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> If
now, we connect this fact with what has been noticed
respecting the vast river-system which distinguishes
the east of America from the west, it becomes evident
that in South America there exists that coöperation of
heat and humidity in which North America is deficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
The result is, that the soil in the eastern part of South
America is remarkable for its exuberance, not only
within the tropic, but considerably beyond it; the
south of Brazil, and even part of Uruguay, possessing
a fertility not to be found in any country of North
America situated under a corresponding latitude.</p>

<p>On a hasty view of the preceding generalizations,
it might be expected that the eastern side of South
America, being thus richly endowed by nature,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> would
have been the seat of one of those civilizations, which,
in other parts of the world, similar causes produced.
But if we look a little further, we shall find that what
has just been pointed out, by no means exhausts even
the physical bearings of this subject, and that we must
take into consideration a third great agent, which has
sufficed to neutralize the natural results of the other
two, and to retain in barbarism the inhabitants of what
otherwise would have been the most flourishing of all
the countries of the New World.</p>

<p>The agent to which I allude is the trade-wind; a
striking phenomenon, by which, as we shall hereafter
see, all the civilizations anterior to those of Europe
were greatly and injuriously influenced. This wind
covers no less than 56° of latitude; 28° north of the
equator, and 28° south of it.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> In this large tract,
which comprises some of the most fertile countries in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the world, the trade-wind blows, during the whole
year, either from the north-east or from the south-east.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
The causes of this regularity are now well
understood, and are known to depend partly on the
displacement of air at the equator, and partly on the
motion of the earth; for the cold air from the poles is
constantly flowing towards the equator, and thus producing
northerly winds in the northern hemisphere,
and southerly winds in the southern. These winds
are, however, deflected from their natural course by
the movement of the earth, as it revolves on its axis
from west to east. And as the rotation of the earth
is, of course, more rapid at the equator than elsewhere,
it happens that in the neighbourhood of the equator
the speed is so great as to outstrip the movements of
the atmosphere from the poles, and forcing them into
another direction, gives rise to those easterly currents
which are called trade-winds.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> What, however, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
are now rather concerned with, is not so much an explanation
of the trade-winds, as an account of the way
in which this great physical phenomenon is connected
with the history of South America.</p>

<p>The trade-wind, blowing on the eastern coast of
South America, and proceeding from the east, crosses
the Atlantic Ocean, and therefore reaches the land surcharged
with the vapours accumulated in its passage.
These vapours, on touching the shore, are, at periodical
intervals, condensed into rain; and as their progress
westward is checked by that gigantic chain of the
Andes, which they are unable to pass,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> they pour
the whole of their moisture on Brazil, which, in
consequence, is often deluged by the most destructive
torrents.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> This abundant supply, being aided by
that vast river-system peculiar to the eastern part of
America, and being also accompanied by heat, has
stimulated the soil into an activity unequalled in any
other part of the world.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Brazil, which is nearly as
large as the whole of Europe, is covered with a vegetation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of incredible profusion. Indeed, so rank and
luxuriant is the growth, that Nature seems to riot in
the very wantonness of power. A great part of this
immense country is filled with dense and tangled
forests, whose noble trees, blossoming in unrivalled
beauty, and exquisite with a thousand hues, throw out
their produce in endless prodigality. On their summit
are perched birds of gorgeous plumage, which nestle
in their dark and lofty recesses. Below, their base
and trunks are crowded with brushwood, creeping
plants, innumerable parasites, all swarming with life.
There, too, are myriads of insects of every variety;
reptiles of strange and singular form; serpents and
lizards, spotted with deadly beauty: all of which find
means of existence in this vast workshop and repository
of Nature. And that nothing may be wanting to
this land of marvels, the forests are skirted by enormous
meadows, which, reeking with heat and moisture,
supply nourishment to countless herds of wild cattle,
that browse and fatten on their herbage; while the
adjoining plains, rich in another form of life, are the
chosen abode of the subtlest and most ferocious animals,
which prey on each other, but which it might
almost seem no human power can hope to extirpate.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Such is the flow and abundance of life by which
Brazil is marked above all the other countries of
the earth.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> But, amid this pomp and splendour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Nature, no place is left for Man. He is reduced to
insignificance by the majesty with which he is surrounded.
The forces that oppose him are so formidable
that he has never been able to make head against
them, never able to rally against their accumulated
pressure. The whole of Brazil, notwithstanding its
immense apparent advantages, has always remained
entirely uncivilized; its inhabitants wandering savages,
incompetent to resist those obstacles which the very
bounty of Nature had put in their way. For the natives,
like every people in the infancy of society, are averse
to enterprise; and being unacquainted with the arts by
which physical impediments are removed, they have
never attempted to grapple with the difficulties that
stopped their social progress. Indeed, those difficulties
are so serious, that during more than three hundred
years the resources of European knowledge have been
vainly employed in endeavouring to get rid of them.
Along the coast of Brazil, there has been introduced
from Europe a certain amount of that civilization,
which the natives by their own efforts could never
have reached. But such civilization, in itself very
imperfect, has never penetrated the recesses of the
country; and in the interior there is still found a state
of things similar to that which has always existed.
The people, ignorant, and therefore brutal, practising
no restraint, and recognizing no law, continue to live
on in their old and inveterate barbarism.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> In their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
country, the physical causes are so active, and do their
work on a scale of such unrivalled magnitude, that it
has hitherto been found impossible to escape from the
effects of their united action. The progress of agriculture
is stopped by impassable forests, and the harvests
are destroyed by innumerable insects.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The
mountains are too high to scale, the rivers are too
wide to bridge; every thing is contrived to keep back
the human mind, and repress its rising ambition. It
is thus that the energies of Nature have hampered the
spirit of Man. Nowhere else is there so painful a contrast
between the grandeur of the external world and
the littleness of the internal. And the mind, cowed by
this unequal struggle, has not only been unable to
advance, but without foreign aid it would undoubtedly
have receded. For even at present, with all the improvements
constantly introduced from Europe, there
are no signs of real progress; while, notwithstanding the
frequency of colonial settlements, less than one-fiftieth
of the land is cultivated.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The habits of the people
are as barbarous as ever; and as to their numbers, it
is well worthy of remark, that Brazil, the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
where, of all others, physical resources are most powerful,
where both vegetables and animals are most abundant,
where the soil is watered by the noblest rivers,
and the coast studded by the finest harbours&mdash;this
immense territory, which is more than twelve times
the size of France, contains a population not exceeding
six millions of people.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>These considerations sufficiently explain why it is,
that in the whole of Brazil there are no monuments even
of the most imperfect civilization; no evidence that the
people had, at any period, raised themselves above the
state in which they were found when their country was
first discovered. But immediately opposite to Brazil
there is another country, which, though situated in the
same continent, and lying under the same latitude, is
subjected to different physical conditions, and therefore
was the scene of different social results. This is the celebrated
kingdom of Peru, which included the whole of the
southern tropic, and which, from the circumstances just
stated, was naturally the only part of South America
where any thing approaching to civilization could be
attained. In Brazil, the heat of the climate was accompanied
by a twofold irrigation, arising first from the immense
river-system incidental to the eastern coast; and
secondly, from the abundant moisture deposited by the
trade-winds. From this combination there resulted that
unequalled fertility, which, so far as Man was concerned,
defeated its own ends, stopping his progress by an exuberance,
which, had it been less excessive, it would have
aided. For, as we have clearly seen, when the productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
powers of Nature are carried beyond a certain point, the
imperfect knowledge of uncivilized men is unable to cope
with them, or in any way turn them to their own advantage.
If, however, those powers, being very active, are
nevertheless confined within manageable limits, there
arises a state of things similar to that noticed in Asia and
Africa; where the profusion of Nature, instead of hindering
social progress, favoured it, by encouraging that
accumulation of wealth, without some share of which
progress is impossible.</p>

<p>In estimating, therefore, the physical conditions by
which civilization was originally determined, we have to
look, not merely at the exuberance, but also at what may
be called the manageability of Nature; that is, we have
to consider the ease with which the resources may be
used, as well as the number of the resources themselves.
Applying this to Mexico and Peru, we find that they
were the countries of America where this combination
most happily occurred. For though their resources were
much less numerous than those of Brazil, they were far
more easy to control; while at the same time the heat
of the climate brought into play those other laws by
which, as I have attempted to show, all the early civilizations
were greatly influenced. It is a very remarkable
fact, which, I believe, has never been observed, that even
in reference to latitude, the present limit of Peru to the
south corresponds with the ancient limit of Mexico to the
north; while, by a striking, but to me perfectly natural
coincidence, both these boundaries are reached before the
tropical line is passed; the boundary of Mexico being
21° N. lat., that of Peru 21&frac12;° S. lat.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Such is the wonderful regularity which history, when
comprehensively studied, presents to our view. And if
we compare Mexico and Peru with those countries of the
Old World which have been already noticed, we shall find,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
as in all the civilizations anterior to those of Europe, that
their social phenomena were subordinate to their physical
laws. In the first place, the characteristics of their national
food were precisely those met with in the most
flourishing parts of Asia and Africa. For although few
of the nutritious vegetables belonging to the Old World
were found in the New, their place was supplied by
others exactly analogous to rice and dates; that is to
say, marked by the same abundance, by the same facility
of growth, and by the same exuberant returns; therefore,
followed by the same social results. In Mexico and
Peru, one of the most important articles of food has
always been maize, which, we have every reason to believe,
was peculiar to the American continent.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> This, like rice
and dates, is eminently the product of a hot climate; and
although it is said to grow at an elevation of upwards of
7,000 feet,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> it is rarely seen beyond the fortieth parallel,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
and its exuberance rapidly diminishes with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
diminution of temperature. Thus, for example, in New
California, its average yield is seventy or eighty fold;<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
but in Mexico Proper the same grain yields three or four
hundred fold, and, under very favourable circumstances,
even eight hundred fold.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>A people who derived their sustenance from a plant
of such extraordinary fecundity, had little need to exercise
their industrious energies; while at the same time
they had every opportunity of increasing their numbers,
and thus producing a train of social and political consequences
similar to those which I have noticed in India
and in Egypt. Besides this, there were, in addition to
maize, other kinds of food to which the same remarks are
applicable. The potato, which, in Ireland, has brought
about such injurious effects by stimulating the growth
of population, is said to be indigenous to Peru; and
although this is denied by a very high authority,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> there
is, at all events, no doubt that it was found there in great
abundance when the country was first discovered by the
Europeans.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> In Mexico, potatoes were unknown till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
arrival of the Spaniards; but both Mexicans and Peruvians
lived to a great extent on the produce of the
banana; a vegetable whose reproductive powers are so
extraordinary, that nothing but the precise and unimpeachable
testimony of which we are possessed could
make them at all credible. This remarkable plant is, in
America, intimately connected with the physical laws of
climate; since it is an article of primary importance for
the subsistence of man whenever the temperature passes
a certain point.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Of its nutritive powers, it is enough
to say, that an acre sown with it will support more than
fifty persons; whereas the same amount of land sown
with wheat in Europe will only support two persons.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
As to the exuberance of its growth, it is calculated that,
other circumstances remaining the same, its produce is
forty-four times greater than that of potatoes, and a hundred
and thirty-three times greater than that of wheat.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>It will now be easily understood why it was that, in
all important respects, the civilizations of Mexico and
Peru were strictly analogous to those of India and Egypt.
In these four countries, as well as in a few others in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Southern Asia and Central America, there existed an
amount of knowledge, despicable indeed if tried by an
European standard, but most remarkable if contrasted
with the gross ignorance which prevailed among the
adjoining and cotemporary nations. But in all of them
there was the same inability to diffuse even that scanty
civilization which they really possessed; there was the
same utter absence of any thing approaching to the democratic
spirit; there was the same despotic power on
the part of the upper classes, and the same contemptible
subservience on the part of the lower. For, as we
have clearly seen, all these civilizations were affected
by certain physical causes, which, though favourable to
the accumulation of wealth, were unfavourable to a just
subdivision of it. And as the knowledge of men was still
in its infancy,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> it was found impossible to struggle
against these physical agents, or prevent them from producing
those effects on the social organization which I
have attempted to trace. Both in Mexico and in Peru,
the arts, and particularly those branches of them which
minister to the luxury of the wealthy classes, were cultivated
with great success. The houses of the higher
ranks were filled with ornaments and utensils of admirable
workmanship; their chambers were hung with
splendid tapestries; their dresses and their personal decorations
betrayed an almost incredible expense; their
jewels of exquisite and varied form; their rich and flowing
robes embroidered with the rarest feathers, collected
from the most distant parts of the empire: all supplying
evidence of the possession of unlimited wealth, and of
the ostentatious prodigality with which that wealth was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
wasted.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Immediately below this class came the people;
and what their condition was, may be easily imagined.
In Peru the whole of the taxes were paid by them; the
nobles and the clergy being altogether exempt.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> But as,
in such a state of society, it was impossible for the people
to accumulate property, they were obliged to defray the
expenses of government by their personal labour, which
was placed under the entire command of the state.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> At
the same time, the rulers of the country were well aware
that, with a system like this, feelings of personal independence
were incompatible; they therefore contrived laws
by which, even in the most minute matters, freedom of
action was controlled. The people were so shackled, that
they could neither change their residence, nor alter their
clothes, without permission from the governing powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
To each man the law prescribed the trade he was to
follow, the dress he was to wear, the wife he was to
marry, and the amusements he was to enjoy.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Among
the Mexicans the course of affairs was similar; the same
physical conditions being followed by the same social
results. In the most essential particular for which history
can be studied, namely, the state of the people, Mexico
and Peru are the counterpart of each other. For though
there were many minor points of difference,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> both were
agreed in this, that there were only two classes&mdash;the
upper class being tyrants, and the lower class being
slaves. This was the state in which Mexico was found
when it was discovered by the Europeans,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> and towards
which it must have been tending from the earliest period.
And so insupportable had all this become, that we know,
from the most decisive evidence, that the general disaffection
it produced among the people was one of the
causes which, by facilitating the progress of the Spanish
invaders, hastened the downfall of the Mexican empire.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The further this examination is carried, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
striking becomes the similarity between those civilizations
which flourished anterior to what may be called the
European epoch of the human mind. The division of
a nation into castes would be impossible in the great
European countries; but it existed from a remote antiquity
in Egypt, in India, and apparently in Persia.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
The very same institution was rigidly enforced in
Peru;<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and what proves how consonant it was to that
stage of society, is, that in Mexico, where castes were
not established by law, it was nevertheless a recognised
custom that the son should follow the occupation of his
father.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> This was the political symptom of that stationary
and conservative spirit, which, as we shall
hereafter see, has marked every country in which the
upper classes have monopolized power. The religious
symptom of the same spirit was displayed in that inordinate
reverence for antiquity, and in that hatred of
change, which the greatest of all the writers on America
has well pointed out as an analogy between the
natives of Mexico and those of Hindostan.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> To this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
may be added, that those who have studied the history
of the ancient Egyptians, have observed among that
people a similar tendency. Wilkinson, who is well
known to have paid great attention to their monuments,
says that they were more unwilling than any other
nation to alter their religious worship;<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and Herodotus,
who travelled in their country two thousand
three hundred years ago, assures us that, while they
preserved old customs, they never acquired new ones.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
In another point of view, the similarity between these
distant countries is equally interesting, since it evidently
arises from the causes already noticed as common
to both. In Mexico and Peru, the lower classes
being at the disposal of the upper, there followed that
frivolous waste of labour which we have observed in
Egypt, and evidence of which may also be seen in the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of those temples and palaces which are still found
in several parts of Asia. Both Mexicans and Peruvians
erected immense buildings, which were as useless as
those of Egypt, and which no country could produce,
unless the labour of the people were ill-paid and ill
directed.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The cost of these monuments of vanity is
unknown; but it must have been enormous; since the
Americans, being ignorant of the use of iron,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> were
unable to employ a resource by which, in the construction
of large works, labour is greatly abridged.
Some particulars, however, have been preserved, from
which an idea may be formed on this subject. To
take, for instance, the palaces of their kings: we find
that in Peru, the erection of the royal residence occupied,
during fifty years, 20,000 men;<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> while that of
Mexico cost the labour of no less than 200,000:
striking facts, which, if all other testimonies had
perished, would enable us to appreciate the condition
of countries in which, for such insignificant purposes,
such vast power was expended.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>The preceding evidence, collected from sources of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
unquestioned credibility, proves the force of those great
physical laws, which, in the most flourishing countries
out of Europe, encouraged the accumulation of wealth,
but prevented its dispersion; and thus secured to the
upper classes a monopoly of one of the most important
elements of social and political power. The result was,
that in all those civilizations the great body of the
people derived no benefit from the national improvements;
hence, the basis of the progress being very
narrow, the progress itself was very insecure.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> When,
therefore, unfavourable circumstances arose from without,
it was but natural that the whole system should
fall to the ground. In such countries, society, being
divided against itself, was unable to stand. And there
can be no doubt that long before the crisis of their actual
destruction, these one-sided and irregular civilizations
had begun to decay; so that their own degeneracy
aided the progress of foreign invaders, and secured the
overthrow of those ancient kingdoms, which, under a
sounder system, might have been easily saved.</p>

<p>Thus far as to the way in which the great civilizations
exterior to Europe have been affected by the
peculiarities of their food, climate, and soil. It now
remains for me to examine the effect of those other
physical agents to which I have given the collective
name of Aspects of Nature, and which will be found suggestive
of some very wide and comprehensive inquiries
into the influence exercised by the external world in
predisposing men to certain habits of thought, and thus
giving a particular tone to religion, arts, literature,
and, in a word, to all the principal manifestations of
the human mind. To ascertain how this is brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
about, forms a necessary supplement to the investigations
just concluded. For, as we have seen that
climate, food, and soil mainly concern the accumulation
and distribution of wealth, so also shall we see
that the Aspects of Nature concern the accumulation
and distribution of thought. In the first case, we have
to do with the material interests of Man; in the other
case with his intellectual interests. The former I have
analyzed as far as I am able, and perhaps as far as the
existing state of knowledge will allow.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> But the
other, namely, the relation between the Aspects of
Nature and the mind of Man, involves speculations of
such magnitude, and requires such a mass of materials
drawn from every quarter, that I feel very apprehensive
as to the result; and I need hardly say, that I
make no pretensions to anything approaching an exhaustive
analysis, nor can I hope to do more than
generalize a few of the laws of that complicated, but
as yet unexplored, process by which the external world
has affected the human mind, has warped its natural
movements, and too often checked its natural progress.</p>

<p>The Aspects of Nature, when considered from this
point of view, are divisible into two classes: the first
class being those which are most likely to excite the
imagination; and the other class being those which
address themselves to the understanding commonly so
called, that is, to the mere logical operations of the
intellect. For although it is true that, in a complete
and well-balanced mind, the imagination and the understanding
each play their respective parts, and are
auxiliary to each other, it is also true that, in a
majority of instances, the understanding is too weak
to curb the imagination and restrain its dangerous
licence. The tendency of advancing civilization is to
remedy this disproportion, and invest the reasoning
powers with that authority, which, in an early stage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Society, the imagination exclusively possesses. Whether
or not there is ground for fearing that the reaction will
eventually proceed too far, and that the reasoning
faculties will in their turn tyrannize over the imaginative
ones, is a question of the deepest interest; but, in
the present condition of our knowledge, it is probably an
insoluble one. At all events, it is certain that nothing
like such a state has yet been seen; since, even in this
age, when the imagination is more under control than
in any preceding one, it has far too much power; as
might be easily proved, not only from the superstitions
which in every country still prevail among the vulgar,
but also from that poetic reverence for antiquity, which,
though it has been long diminishing, still hampers the
independence, blinds the judgment, and circumscribes
the originality of the educated classes.</p>

<p>Now, so far as natural phenomena are concerned, it
is evident, that whatever inspires feelings of terror, or
of great wonder, and whatever excites in the mind
an idea of the vague and uncontrollable, has a special
tendency to inflame the imagination, and bring under
its dominion the slower and more deliberate operations
of the understanding. In such cases, Man, contrasting
himself with the force and majesty of Nature, becomes
painfully conscious of his own insignificance. A sense
of inferiority steals over him. From every quarter
innumerable obstacles hem him in, and limit his individual
will. His mind, appalled by the indefined and
indefinable, hardly cares to scrutinize the details of
which such imposing grandeur consists.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
other hand, where the works of Nature are small and
feeble, Man regains confidence; he seems more able to
rely on his own power; he can, as it were, pass through
and exercise authority in every direction. And as the
phenomena are more accessible, it becomes easier for
him to experiment on them, or to observe them with
minuteness; an inquisitive and analytic spirit is encouraged,
and he is tempted to generalize the appearances
of Nature, and refer them to the laws by which
they are governed.</p>

<p>Looking in this way at the human mind as affected
by the Aspects of Nature, it is surely a remarkable
fact, that all the great early civilizations were situated
within and immediately adjoining the tropics, where
those aspects are most sublime, most terrible, and
where Nature is, in every respect, most dangerous to
Man. Indeed, generally, in Asia, Africa, and America,
the external world is more formidable than in Europe.
This holds good not only of the fixed and permanent
phenomena, such as mountains, and other great natural
barriers, but also of occasional phenomena, such as
earthquakes, tempests, hurricanes, pestilences; all of
which are in those regions very frequent and very
disastrous. These constant and serious dangers produce
effects analogous to those caused by the sublimity
of Nature, in so far, that in both cases there is a tendency
to increase the activity of the imagination. For
the peculiar province of the imagination being to deal
with the unknown, every event which is unexplained,
as well as important, is a direct stimulus to our imaginative
faculties. In the tropics, events of this kind are
more numerous than elsewhere; it therefore follows
that in the tropics the imagination is most likely to
triumph. A few illustrations of the working of this
principle will place it in a clearer light, and will prepare
the reader for the arguments based upon it.</p>

<p>Of those physical events which increase the insecurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of Man, earthquakes are certainly among the most
striking, in regard to the loss of life which they cause,
as also in regard to their sudden and unexpected occurrence.
There is reason to believe that they are always
preceded by atmospheric changes which strike immediately
at the nervous system, and thus have a direct
physical tendency to impair the intellectual powers.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
However this may be, there can be no doubt as to the
effect they produce in encouraging particular associations
and habits of thought. The terror which they
inspire excites the imagination even to a painful extent,
and, overbalancing the judgment, predisposes men to
superstitious fancies. And what is highly curious, is,
that repetition, so far from blunting such feelings,
strengthens them. In Peru, where earthquakes appear
to be more common than in any other country,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> every
succeeding visitation increases the general dismay; so
that, in some cases, the fear becomes almost insupportable.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
The mind is thus constantly thrown into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
timid and anxious state: and men witnessing the most
serious dangers, which they can neither avoid nor understand,
become impressed with a conviction of their
own inability, and of the poverty of their own resources.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
In exactly the same proportion, the imagination
is aroused, and a belief in supernatural interference
actively encouraged. Human power failing,
superhuman power is called in; the mysterious and
the invisible are believed to be present; and there
grow up among the people those feelings of awe and of
helplessness, on which all superstition is based, and
without which no superstition can exist.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Further illustration of this may be found even in
Europe, where such phenomena are, comparatively
speaking, extremely rare. Earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions are more frequent and more destructive in
Italy, and in the Spanish and Portuguese peninsula,
than in any other of the great countries; and it is precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
there that superstition is most rife, and the
superstitious classes most powerful. Those were the
countries where the clergy first established their
authority, where the worst corruptions of Christianity
took place, and where superstition has during the
longest period retained the firmest hold. To this may
be added another circumstance, indicative of the connexion
between these physical phenomena and the
predominance of the imagination. Speaking generally,
the fine arts are addressed more to the imagination;
the sciences to the intellect.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Now it is remarkable,
that all the greatest painters, and nearly all the greatest
sculptors, modern Europe has possessed, have been
produced by the Italian and Spanish peninsulas. In
regard to science, Italy has no doubt had several men
of conspicuous ability; but their numbers are out of
all proportion small when compared with her artists
and poets. As to Spain and Portugal, the literature of
those two countries is eminently poetic, and from their
schools have proceeded some of the greatest painters
the world has ever seen. On the other hand, the
purely reasoning faculties have been neglected, and the
whole Peninsula, from the earliest period to the present
time, does not supply to the history of the natural
sciences a single name of the highest merit; not one
man whose works form an epoch in the progress of
European knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>The manner in which the Aspects of Nature, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
they are very threatening, stimulate the imagination,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
and by encouraging superstition discourage knowledge,
may be made still more apparent by one or two additional
facts. Among an ignorant people, there is a direct
tendency to ascribe all serious dangers to supernatural
intervention; and a strong religious sentiment being thus
aroused,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> it constantly happens, not only that the danger
is submitted to, but that it is actually worshipped. This
is the case with some of the Hindus in the forest of Malabar;<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
and many similar instances will occur to whoever
has studied the condition of barbarous tribes.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Indeed,
so far is this carried, that in some countries the inhabitants,
from feelings of reverential fear, refuse to destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
wild-beasts and noxious reptiles; the mischief these animals
inflict being the cause of the impunity they enjoy.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>It is in this way, that the old tropical civilizations had
to struggle with innumerable difficulties unknown to the
temperate zone, where European civilization has long flourished.
The devastations of animals hostile to man, the
ravages of hurricanes, tempests, earthquakes,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and
similar perils, constantly pressed upon them, and affected
the tone of their national character. For the mere loss
of life was the smallest part of the inconvenience. The
real mischief was, that there were engendered in the
mind, associations which made the imagination predominate
over the understanding; which infused into the
people a spirit of reverence instead of a spirit of inquiry;
and which encouraged a disposition to neglect the investigation
of natural causes, and ascribe events to the
operation of supernatural ones.</p>

<p>Everything we know of those countries proves how
active this tendency must have been. With extremely few
exceptions, health is more precarious, and disease more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
common, in tropical climates than in temperate ones.
Now, it has been often observed, and indeed is very
obvious, that the fear of death makes men more prone
to seek supernatural aid than they would otherwise be.
So complete is our ignorance respecting another life, that
it is no wonder if even the stoutest heart should quail
at the sudden approach of that dark and untried future.
On this subject the reason is perfectly silent; the imagination,
therefore, is uncontrolled. The operation of natural
causes being brought to an end, supernatural causes are
supposed to begin. Hence it is, that whatever increases
in any country the amount of dangerous disease, has an
immediate tendency to strengthen superstition, and
aggrandize the imagination at the expense of the understanding.
This principle is so universal, that, in every
part of the world, the vulgar ascribe to the intervention
of the Deity those diseases which are peculiarly fatal, and
especially those which have a sudden and mysterious
appearance. In Europe it used to be believed that every
pestilence was a manifestation of the divine anger;<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and
this opinion, though it has long been dying away, is by
no means extinct, even in the most civilized countries.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Superstition of this kind will of course be strongest,
either where medical knowledge is most backward, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
where disease is most abundant. In countries where
both these conditions are fulfilled, the superstition is
supreme; and even where only one of the conditions
exists, the tendency is so irresistible, that, I believe, there
are no barbarous people who do not ascribe to their good
or evil deities, not only extraordinary diseases, but even
many of the ordinary ones to which they are liable.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have another specimen of the unfavourable
influence, which, in the old civilizations, external
phenomena exercised over the human mind. For those
parts of Asia where the highest refinement was reached,
are, from various physical causes, much more unhealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
than the most civilized parts of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> This fact
alone must have produced a considerable effect on the
national character,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and the more so, as it was aided by
those other circumstances which I have pointed out, all
tending in the same direction. To this may be added,
that the great plagues by which Europe has at different
periods been scourged, have, for the most part, proceeded
from the East, which is their natural birthplace, and
where they are most fatal. Indeed, of those cruel diseases
now existing in Europe, scarcely one is indigenous; and
the worst of them were imported from tropical countries
in and after the first century of the Christian era.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Summing up these facts, it may be stated, that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
civilizations exterior to Europe, all nature conspired to
increase the authority of the imaginative faculties, and
weaken the authority of the reasoning ones. With the
materials now existing, it would be possible to follow this
vast law to its remotest consequences, and show how in
Europe it is opposed by another law diametrically opposite,
and by virtue of which the tendency of natural
phenomena is, on the whole, to limit the imagination, and
embolden the understanding: thus inspiring Man with
confidence in his own resources, and facilitating the
increase of his knowledge, by encouraging that bold, inquisitive,
and scientific spirit, which is constantly advancing,
and on which all future progress must depend.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that I can trace in detail the
way in which, owing to these peculiarities, the civilization
of Europe has diverged from all others that preceded
it. To do this, would require a learning and a
reach of thought to which hardly any single man ought
to pretend; since it is one thing to have a perception
of a large and general truth, and it is another thing to
follow out that truth in all its ramifications, and prove
it by such evidence as will satisfy ordinary readers.
Those, indeed, who are accustomed to speculations of
this character, and are able to discern in the history of
man something more than a mere relation of events,
will at once understand that in these complicated subjects,
the wider any generalization is, the greater will
be the chance of apparent exceptions; and that when
the theory covers a very large space, the exceptions
may be innumerable, and yet the theory remain perfectly
accurate. The two fundamental propositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
which I hope to have demonstrated, are, 1st, That there
are certain natural phenomena which act on the human
mind by exciting the imagination; and 2dly, That
those phenomena are much more numerous out of
Europe than in it. If these two propositions are admitted,
it inevitably follows, that in those countries
where the imagination has received the stimulus, some
specific effects must have been produced; unless, indeed,
the effects have been neutralized by other causes.
Whether or not there have been antagonistic causes, is
immaterial to the truth of the theory, which is based
on the two propositions just stated. In a scientific
point of view, therefore, the generalization is complete;
and it would perhaps be prudent to leave it as it now
stands, rather than attempt to confirm it by further
illustrations, since all particular facts are liable to be
erroneously stated, and are sure to be contradicted by
those who dislike the conclusions they corroborate.
But in order to familiarize the reader with the principles
I have put forward, it does seem advisable that a
few instances should be given of their actual working:
and I will, therefore, briefly notice the effects they have
produced in the three great divisions of Literature,
Religion, and Art. In each of these departments, I
will endeavour to indicate how the leading features
have been affected by the Aspects of Nature; and with
a view of simplifying the inquiry, I will take the two
most conspicuous instances on each side, and compare
the manifestations of the intellect of Greece with those
of the intellect of India: these being the two countries
respecting which the materials are most ample, and in
which the physical contrasts are most striking.</p>

<p>If, then, we look at the ancient literature of India,
even during its best period, we shall find the most remarkable
evidence of the uncontrolled ascendency of
the imagination. In the first place, we have the striking
fact that scarcely any attention has been paid to prose
composition; all the best writers having devoted themselves
to poetry, as being most congenial to the national
habits of thought. Their works on grammar, on law,
on history, on medicine, on mathematics, on geography,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and on metaphysics, are nearly all poems, and are
put together according to a regular system of versification.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
The consequence is, that while prose writing
is utterly despised, the art of poetry has been cultivated
so assiduously, that the Sanscrit can boast of metres
more numerous and more complicated than have ever
been possessed by any of the European languages.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>This peculiarity in the form of Indian literature is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
accompanied by a corresponding peculiarity in its spirit.
For it is no exaggeration to say, that in that literature
every thing is calculated to set the reason of man at
open defiance. An imagination, luxuriant even to
disease, runs riot on every occasion. This is particularly
seen in those productions which are most eminently
national, such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharat,
and the Puranas in general. But we also find it even
in their geographical and chronological systems, which
of all others might be supposed least liable to imaginative
flights. A few examples of the statements
put forward in the most authoritative books, will supply
the means of instituting a comparison with the totally
opposite condition of the European intellect, and will
give the reader some idea of the extent to which credulity
can proceed, even among a civilized people.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>Of all the various ways in which the imagination has
distorted truth, there is none that has worked so much
harm as an exaggerated respect for past ages. This
reverence for antiquity is repugnant to every maxim of
reason, and is merely the indulgence of a poetic sentiment
in favour of the remote and unknown. It is,
therefore, natural that, in periods when the intellect
was comparatively speaking inert, this sentiment should
have been far stronger than it now is; and there can
be little doubt that it will continue to grow weaker,
and that in the same proportion the feeling of progress
will gain ground; so that veneration for the past will
be succeeded by hope for the future. But formerly the
veneration was supreme, and innumerable traces of it
may be found in the literature and popular creed of
every country. It is this, for instance, which inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the poets with their notion of a golden age, in which
the world was filled with peace, in which evil passions
were stilled, and crimes were unknown. It is this,
again, which gave to theologians their idea of the primitive
virtue and simplicity of man, and of his subsequent
fall from that high estate. And it is this same
principle which diffused a belief that in the olden
times, men were not only more virtuous and happy,
but also physically superior in the structure of their
bodies; and that by this means they attained to a
larger stature, and lived to a greater age, than is possible
for us, their feeble and degenerate descendants.</p>

<p>Opinions of this kind, being adopted by the imagination
in spite of the understanding, it follows that the
strength of such opinions becomes, in any country, one
of the standards by which we may estimate the predominance
of the imaginative faculties. Applying this
test to the literature of India, we shall find a striking
confirmation of the conclusions already drawn. The
marvellous feats of antiquity with which the Sanscrit
books abound, are so long and so complicated, that it
would occupy too much space to give even an outline
of them; but there is one class of these singular fictions
which is well worth attention, and admits of being
briefly stated. I allude to the extraordinary age which
man was supposed to have attained in former times.
A belief in the longevity of the human race, at an early
period of the world, was the natural product of those
feelings which ascribed to the ancients an universal
superiority over the moderns; and this we see exemplified
in some of the Christian, and in many of the
Hebrew writings. But the statements in these works
are tame and insignificant when compared with what is
preserved in the literature of India. On this, as on
every subject, the imagination of the Hindus distanced
all competition. Thus, among an immense number of
similar facts, we find it recorded that in ancient times
the duration of the life of common men was 80,000
years,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and that holy men lived to be upwards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
100,000.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Some died a little sooner, others a little
later; but in the most flourishing period of antiquity,
if we take all classes together, 100,000 years was the
average.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Of one king, whose name was Yudhishthir,
it is casually mentioned that he reigned 27,000
years;<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> while another, called Alarka, reigned
66,000.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> They were cut off in their prime, since
there are several instances of the early poets living to
be about half-a-million.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> But the most remarkable
case is that of a very shining character in Indian history,
who united in his single person the functions of a
king and a saint. This eminent man lived in a
pure and virtuous age, and his days were, indeed, long
in the land; since, when he was made king, he was two
million years old: he then reigned 6,300,000 years;
having done which, he resigned his empire, and lingered
on for 100,000 years more.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>The same boundless reverence for antiquity made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the Hindus refer every thing important to the most
distant periods; and they frequently assign a date which
is absolutely bewildering.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Their great collection of
laws, called the <i>Institutes of Menu</i>, is certainly less than
3,000 years old; but the Indian chronologists, so far
from being satisfied with this, ascribe to them an age
that the sober European mind finds a difficulty even in
conceiving. According to the best native authorities,
these Institutes were revealed to man about two thousand
million years before the present era.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>All this is but a part of that love of the remote, that
straining after the infinite, and that indifference to the
present, which characterizes every branch of the Indian
intellect. Not only in literature, but also in religion
and in art, this tendency is supreme. To subjugate the
understanding, and exalt the imagination, is the universal
principle. In the dogmas of their theology, in
the character of their gods, and even in the forms of
their temples, we see how the sublime and threatening
aspects of the external world have filled the mind of
the people with those images of the grand and the
terrible, which they strive to reproduce in a visible
form, and to which they owe the leading peculiarities
of their national culture.</p>

<p>Our view of this vast process may be made clearer
by comparing it with the opposite condition of Greece.
In Greece, we see a country altogether the reverse of
India. The works of nature, which in India are of
startling magnitude, are in Greece far smaller, feebler,
and in every way less threatening to man. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
great centre of Asiatic civilization, the energies of the
human race are confined, and as it were intimidated, by
the surrounding phenomena. Besides the dangers incidental
to tropical climates, there are those noble
mountains, which seem to touch the sky, and from
whose sides are discharged mighty rivers, which no
art can divert from their course, and which no bridge
has ever been able to span. There, too, are impassable
forests, whole countries lined with interminable jungle,
and beyond them, again, dreary and boundless deserts;
all teaching Man his own feebleness, and his inability
to cope with natural forces. Without, and on either
side, there are great seas, ravaged by tempests far
more destructive than any known in Europe, and of
such sudden violence, that it is impossible to guard
against their effects. And, as if in those regions every
thing combined to cramp the activity of Man, the whole
line of coast, from the mouth of the Ganges to the extreme
south of the peninsula, does not contain a single
safe and capacious harbour, not one port that affords a
refuge, which is perhaps more necessary there than in
any other part of the world.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>But in Greece, the aspects of nature are so entirely
different, that the very conditions of existence are
changed. Greece, like India, forms a peninsula; but
while in the Asiatic country every thing is great and
terrible, in the European country every thing is small
and feeble. The whole of Greece occupies a space
somewhat less than the kingdom of Portugal,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
about a fortieth part of what is now called Hindustan.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Situated in the most accessible part of a narrow sea, it
had easy contact on the east with Asia Minor, on the
west with Italy, on the south with Egypt. Dangers of
all kinds were far less numerous than in the tropical
civilizations. The climate was more healthy;<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> earthquakes
were less frequent; hurricanes were less disastrous;
wild-beasts and noxious animals less abundant.
In regard to the other great features, the same law
prevails. The highest mountains in Greece are less
than one-third of the Himalaya, so that nowhere do
they reach the limit of perpetual snow.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> As to rivers,
not only is there nothing approaching those imposing
volumes which are poured down from the mountains of
Asia, but nature is so singularly sluggish, that neither
in Northern nor in Southern Greece do we find any
thing beyond a few streams, which are easily forded,
and which, indeed, in the summer season, are frequently
dried up.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>These striking differences in the material phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of the two countries gave rise to corresponding differences
in their mental associations. For as all ideas
must arise partly from what are called spontaneous
operations in the mind, and partly from what is suggested
to the mind by the external world, it was natural
that so great an alteration in one of the causes should
produce an alteration in the effects. The tendency of
the surrounding phenomena was in India to inspire
fear; in Greece to give confidence. In India Man
was intimidated; in Greece he was encouraged. In
India obstacles of every sort were so numerous, so
alarming, and apparently so inexplicable, that the
difficulties of life could only be solved by constantly
appealing to the direct agency of supernatural causes.
Those causes being beyond the province of the understanding,
the resources of the imagination were incessantly
occupied in studying them; the imagination
itself was overworked, its activity became dangerous,
it encroached on the understanding, and the equilibrium
of the whole was destroyed. In Greece opposite circumstances
were followed by opposite results. In Greece
Nature was less dangerous, less intrusive, and less
mysterious than in India. In Greece, therefore, the
human mind was less appalled, and less superstitious;
natural causes began to be studied; physical science
first became possible; and Man, gradually waking to a
sense of his own power, sought to investigate events
with a boldness not to be expected in those other
countries, where the pressure of Nature troubled his
independence, and suggested ideas with which knowledge
is incompatible.</p>

<p>The effect of these habits of thought on the national
religion must be very obvious to whoever has compared
the popular creed of India with that of Greece. The
mythology of India, like that of every tropical country,
is based upon terror, and upon terror, too, of the most
extravagant kind. Evidence of the universality of this
feeling abounds in the sacred books of the Hindus, in
their traditions, and even in the very form and appearance
of their gods. And so deeply is all this impressed
on the mind, that the most popular deities are invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
those with whom images of fear are most intimately
associated. Thus, for example, the worship of Siva is
more general than any other; and as to its antiquity,
there is reason to believe that it was borrowed by the
Brahmins from the original Indians.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> At all events,
it is very ancient, and very popular; and Siva himself
forms, with Brahma and Vishnu, the celebrated Hindu
Triad. We need not, therefore, be surprised that with
this god are connected images of terror, such as nothing
but a tropical imagination could conceive. Siva is represented
to the Indian mind as a hideous being,
encircled by a girdle of snakes, with a human skull in
his hand, and wearing a necklace composed of human
bones. He has three eyes; the ferocity of his temper
is marked by his being clothed in a tiger's skin; he is
represented as wandering about like a madman, and
over his left shoulder the deadly cobra di capella rears
its head. This monstrous creation of an awe-struck
fancy has a wife Doorga, called sometimes Kali, and
sometimes by other names.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> She has a body of dark
blue; while the palms of her hands are red, to indicate
her insatiate appetite for blood. She has four arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
with one of which she carries the skull of a giant; her
tongue protrudes, and hangs lollingly from her mouth;
round her waist are the hands of her victims; and her
neck is adorned with human heads strung together in
a ghastly row.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>If we now turn to Greece, we find, even in the infancy
of its religion, not the faintest trace of any thing
approaching to this. For, in Greece, the causes of fear
being less abundant, the expression of terror was less
common. The Greeks, therefore, were by no means
disposed to incorporate into their religion those feelings
of dread natural to the Hindus. The tendency of
Asiatic civilization was to widen the distance between
men and their deities; the tendency of Greek civilization
was to diminish it. Thus it is, that in Hindostan
all the gods had something monstrous about them; as
Vishnu with four hands, Brahma with five heads, and
the like.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> But the gods of Greece were always represented
in forms entirely human.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> In that country,
no artist would have gained attention, if he had presumed
to portray them in any other shape. He might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
make them stronger than men, he might make them
more beautiful; but still they must be men. The
analogy between God and Man, which excited the
religious feelings of the Greeks, would have been fatal
to those of the Hindus.</p>

<p>This difference between the artistic expressions of
the two religions was accompanied by an exactly similar
difference between their theological traditions. In the
Indian books, the imagination is exhausted in relating
the feats of the gods; and the more obviously impossible
any achievement is, the greater the pleasure with which
it was ascribed to them. But the Greek gods had not
only human forms, but also human attributes, human
pursuits, and human tastes.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The men of Asia, to
whom every object of nature was a source of awe, acquired
such habits of reverence, that they never dared
to assimilate their own actions with the actions of their
deities. The men of Europe, encouraged by the safety
and inertness of the material world, did not fear to strike
a parallel, from which they would have shrunk had they
lived amid the dangers of a tropical country. It is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
that the Greek divinities are so different from those of
the Hindus, that in comparing them we seem to pass
from one creation into another. The Greeks generalized
their observations upon the human mind, and then applied
them to the gods.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The coldness of women was
figured in Diana; their beauty and sensuality in Venus;
their pride in Juno; their accomplishments in Minerva.
To the ordinary avocations of the gods the same principle
was applied. Neptune was a sailor; Vulcan was
a smith; Apollo was sometimes a fiddler, sometimes a
poet, sometimes a keeper of oxen. As to Cupid, he was
a wanton boy, who played with his bow and arrows;
Jupiter was an amorous and good-natured king; while
Mercury was indifferently represented either as a trustworthy
messenger, or else as a common and notorious
thief.</p>

<p>Precisely the same tendency to approximate human
forces towards superhuman ones, is displayed in another
peculiarity of the Greek religion. I mean, that in Greece
we for the first time meet with hero-worship, that is, the
deification of mortals. According to the principles already
laid down, this could not be expected in a tropical civilization,
where the Aspects of Nature filled Man with a
constant sense of his own incapacity. It is, therefore,
natural that it should form no part of the ancient Indian
religion;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> neither was it known to the Egyptians,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> nor
to the Persians,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> nor, so far as I am aware, to the Arabians.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
But in Greece, Man being less humbled, and,
as it were, less eclipsed, by the external world, thought
more of his own powers, and human nature did not fall
into that discredit in which it elsewhere sank. The consequence
was, that the deification of mortals was a recognized
part of the national religion at a very early period
in the history of Greece;<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and this has been found so
natural to Europeans, that the same custom was afterwards
renewed with eminent success by the Romish
Church. Other circumstances, of a very different character,
are gradually eradicating this form of idolatry;
but its existence is worth observing, as one of the innumerable
illustrations of the way in which European civilization
has diverged from all those that preceded it.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>It is thus, that in Greece every thing tended to exalt
the dignity of man, while in India every thing tended to
depress it.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> To sum up the whole, it may be said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the Greeks had more respect for human powers; the
Hindus for superhuman. The first dealt more with the
known and available; the other with the unknown and
mysterious.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> And by a parity of reasoning, the
imagination, which the Hindus, being oppressed by the
pomp and majesty of nature, never sought to control,
lost its supremacy in the little peninsula of ancient
Greece. In Greece, for the first time in the history of the
world, the imagination was, in some degree, tempered
and confined by the understanding. Not that its strength
was impaired, or its vitality diminished. It was broken-in
and tamed; its exuberance was checked, its follies were
chastised. But that its energy remained, we have ample
proof in those productions of the Greek mind which have
survived to our own time. The gain, therefore, was complete;
since the inquiring and sceptical faculties of the
human understanding were cultivated, without destroying
the reverential and poetic instincts of the imagination.
Whether or not the balance was accurately adjusted, is
another question; but it is certain that the adjustment
was more nearly arrived at in Greece than in any previous
civilization.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> There can, I think, be little doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
that, notwithstanding what was effected, too much authority
was left to the imaginative faculties, and that the
purely reasoning ones did not receive, and never have
received, sufficient attention. Still, this does not affect
the great fact, that the Greek literature is the first in
which this deficiency was somewhat remedied, and in
which there was a deliberate and systematic attempt to
test all opinions by their consonance with human reason,
and thus vindicate the right of Man to judge for himself
on matters which are of supreme and incalculable
importance.</p>

<p>I have selected India and Greece as the two terms of
the preceding comparison, because our information respecting
those countries is most extensive, and has been
most carefully arranged. But every thing we know of
the other tropical civilizations confirms the views I have
advocated respecting the effects produced by the Aspects
of Nature. In Central America extensive excavations
have been made; and what has been brought to light
proves that the national religion was, like that of India,
a system of complete and unmitigated terror.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Neither
there nor in Mexico, nor in Peru, nor in Egypt, did the
people desire to represent their deities in human forms,
or ascribe to them human attributes. Even their temples
are huge buildings, often constructed with great skill,
but showing an evident wish to impress the mind with
fear, and offering a striking contrast to the lighter and
smaller structures which the Greeks employed for religious
purposes. Thus, even in the style of architecture
do we see the same principle at work; the dangers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
tropical civilization being more suggestive of the infinite,
while the safety of the European civilization was more
suggestive of the finite. To follow out the consequences
of this great antagonism, it would be necessary to indicate
how the infinite, the imaginative, the synthetic, and the
deductive, are all connected; and are opposed, on the
other hand, by the finite, the sceptical, the analytic, and
the inductive. A complete illustration of this would
carry me beyond the plan of this Introduction and would
perhaps exceed the resources of my own knowledge; and
I must now leave to the candour of the reader what I
am conscious is but an imperfect sketch, but what may,
nevertheless, suggest to him materials for future thought,
and, if I might indulge the hope, may open to historians
a new field, by reminding them that every where the
hand of Nature is upon us, and that the history of the
human mind can only be understood by connecting with
it the history and the aspects of the material universe.</p>

<p class="title"><span class="smcap">Note 36</span> to p. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>.</p>

<p>As these views have a social and economical importance quite
independent of their physiological value, I will endeavour, in this
note, to fortify them still further, by showing that the connexion
between carbonized food and the respiratory functions may be
illustrated by a wider survey of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>The gland most universal among the different classes of animals
is the liver;<a name="FNanchor_a_a" id="FNanchor_a_a"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_a" class="fnanchor">[a]</a> and its principal business is to relieve the system of
its superfluous carbon, which it accomplishes by secreting bile, a
highly carbonized fluid.<a name="FNanchor_b_b" id="FNanchor_b_b"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_b" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> Now, the connexion between this process
and the respiratory functions is highly curious. For, if we take a
general view of animal life, we shall find that the liver and lungs
are nearly always compensatory; that is to say, when one organ is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
small and inert, the other is large and active. Thus, reptiles have
feeble lungs, but a considerable liver;<a name="FNanchor_c_c" id="FNanchor_c_c"></a><a href="#Footnote_c_c" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> and thus, too, in fishes,
which have no lungs, in the ordinary sense of the word, the size of
the liver is often enormous.<a name="FNanchor_d_d" id="FNanchor_d_d"></a><a href="#Footnote_d_d" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> On the other hand, insects have a
very large and complicated system of air tubes; but their liver is
minute, and its functions are habitually sluggish.(<a name="FNanchor_e_e" id="FNanchor_e_e"></a><a href="#Footnote_e_e" class="fnanchor">[e]</a>) If, instead of
comparing the different classes of animals, we compare the different
stages through which the same animal passes, we shall find further
confirmation of this wide and striking principle. For the law holds
good even before birth; since in the unborn infant the lungs have
scarcely any activity, but there is an immense liver, which is full
of energy and pours out bile in profusion.<a name="FNanchor_f_f" id="FNanchor_f_f"></a><a href="#Footnote_f_f" class="fnanchor">[f]</a> And so invariable is
this relation, that in man the liver is the first organ which is
formed: it is preponderant during the whole period of f&oelig;tal life;
but it rapidly diminishes when, after birth, the lungs come into
play, and a new scheme of compensation is established in the
system.<a name="FNanchor_g_g" id="FNanchor_g_g"></a><a href="#Footnote_g_g" class="fnanchor">[g]</a></p>

(<i>Anatomie Générale</i>, vol. ii. p. 272), and by many other physiologists; but Dr.
Elliotson appears to have been one of the first to understand a fact, the explanation
of which we might vainly seek for in the earlier writers. &lsquo;The
hypothesis, that one great use of the liver was, like that of the lungs, to remove
carbon from the system, with this difference, that the alteration of the capacity
of the air caused a reception of caloric into the blood, in the case of the lungs,
while the hepatic excretion takes place without introduction of caloric, was, I
recollect, a great favourite with me when a student&hellip;. The Heidelberg
professors have adduced many arguments to the same effect. In the f&oelig;tus,
for whose temperature the mother's heat must be sufficient, the lungs perform
no function; but the liver is of great size, and bile is secreted abundantly, so
that the meconium accumulates considerably during the latter months of
pregnancy.&rsquo; <i>Elliotson's Human Physiology</i>, 1840, p. 102. In <i>Lepelletier's
Physiologie Médicale</i>, vol. i. p. 466, vol. ii. pp. 14, 546, 550, all this is sadly
confused.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_g_g" id="Footnote_g_g"></a><a href="#FNanchor_g_g"><span class="label">[g]</span></a> &lsquo;The liver is the first-formed organ in the embryo. It is developed from
the alimentary canal, and at about the third week fills the whole abdomen,
and is one-half the weight of the entire embryo&hellip;. At birth it is of
very large size, and occupies the whole upper part of the abdomen&hellip;.
The liver diminishes rapidly after birth, probably from obliteration of the
umbilical vein.&rsquo; <i>Wilson's Human Anatomy</i>, 1851, p. 638. Compare <i>Burdach's
Physiologie</i>, vol. iv. p. 447, where it is said of the liver in childhood, &lsquo;Cet organe
croît avec lenteur, surtout comparativement aux poumons; le rapport de
ceux-ci au foie étant à peu près de 1:3 avant la respiration, il était de 1:1.86
après l'établissement de cette dernière fonction.&rsquo; See also p. 91, and vol. iii.
p. 483; and on the predominance of the liver in f&oelig;tal life, see the remarks of
Serres (<i>Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</i>, <i>Anomalies de l'Organisation</i>, vol. ii. p. 11), whose
generalization is perhaps a little premature.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These facts, interesting to the philosophic physiologist, are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
great moment in reference to the doctrines advocated in this
chapter. Inasmuch as the liver and lungs are compensatory in the
history of their organization, it is highly probable that they are
also compensatory in the functions they perform; and that what is
left undone by one will have to be accomplished by the other.
The liver, therefore, fulfilling the duty, as chemistry teaches us, of
decarbonizing the system by secreting a carbonized fluid, we should
expect, even in the absence of any further evidence, that the lungs
would be likewise decarbonizing; in other words, we should expect
that if, from any cause, we are surcharged with carbon, our lungs
must assist in remedying the evil. This brings us, by another road,
to the conclusion that highly carbonized food has a tendency to tax
the lungs; so that the connexion between a carbonized diet and
the respiratory functions, instead of being, as some assert, a
crude hypothesis, is an eminently scientific theory, and is corroborated
not only by chemistry, but by the general scheme of the
animal kingdom, and even by the observation of embryological
phenomena. The views of Liebig, and of his followers, are indeed
supported by so many analogies, and harmonize so well with other
parts of our knowledge, that nothing but a perverse hatred of
generalization, or an incapacity for dealing with large speculative
truths, can explain the hostility directed against conclusions which
have been gradually forcing themselves upon us since Lavoisier,
seventy years ago, attempted to explain the respiratory functions by
subjecting them to the laws of chemical combination.</p>

<p>In this, and previous notes (see in particular notes 30, 31, 35), I
have considered the connexion between food respiration, and animal
heat, at a length which will appear tedious to readers uninterested
in physiological pursuits; but the investigation has become
necessary, on account of the difficulties raised by experimenters,
who, not having studied the subject comprehensively, object to certain
parts of it. To mention what, from the ability and reputation
of the author, is a conspicuous instance of this, Sir Benjamin
Brodie has recently published a volume (<i>Physiological Researches</i>,
1851) containing some ingeniously contrived experiments on dogs
and rabbits, to prove that heat is generated rather by the nervous
system than by the respiratory organs. Without following this
eminent surgeon into all its details, I may be permitted to observe,
1st, That, as a mere matter of history, no great physiological truth
has ever yet been discovered, nor has any great physiological fallacy
been destroyed, by such limited experiments on a single class
of animals; and this is partly because in physiology a crucial instance
is impracticable, owing to the fact that we deal with resisting
and living bodies, and partly because every experiment produces
an abnormal condition, and thus lets in fresh causes, the operation
of which is incalculable; unless, as often happens in the inorganic
world, we can control the whole phenomenon. 2nd, That the other
department of the organic world, namely, the vegetable kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
has, so far as we are aware, no nervous system, but nevertheless
possesses heat; and we moreover know that the heat is a product
of oxygen and carbon (see note 32 to chapter ii.). 3d, That the
evidence of travellers respecting the different sorts of food, and the
different quantities of food, used in hot countries and in cold ones,
is explicable by the respiratory and chemical theories of the origin
of animal heat, but is inexplicable by the theory of the nervous
origin of heat.</p>

simple question is needlessly complicated. The old Persian writers
bestowed on them the courteous appellation of &lsquo;a band of naked
lizard-eaters.&rsquo; <i>Malcolm's Hist. of Persia</i>, vol. i. p. 133. Indeed,
there are few things in history better proved than the barbarism of a
people whom some writers wish to invest with a romantic interest. The
eulogy passed on them by Meiners is rather suspicious, for he concludes
by saying, &lsquo;die Eroberungen der Araber waren höchst selten so blutig und

raised to a science was astronomy, which began to be cultivated under
the caliphs about the middle of the eighth century, and went on
improving until &lsquo;la ville de Bagdad fut, pendant le dixième siècle, le
théâtre principal de l'astronomie chez les orientaux.&rsquo; <i>Montucla</i>,
<i>Histoire des Mathématiques</i>, vol. i. pp. 355, 364. The old Pagan Arabs,
like most barbarous people living in a clear atmosphere, had such an
empirical acquaintance with the celestial phenomena as was used for
practical purposes; but there is no evidence to justify the common
opinion that they studied this subject as a science. Dr. Dorn
(<i>Transactions of the Asiatic Society</i>, vol. ii. p. 371) says, &lsquo;of a
scientific knowledge of astronomy among them no traces can be
discovered.&rsquo; Beausobre (<i>Histoire de Manichée</i>, vol. i. p. 20) is quite
enthusiastic about the philosophy of the Arabs in the time of
Pythagoras! and he tells us, that &lsquo;ces peuples out toujours cultivé les
sciences.&rsquo; To establish this fact, he quotes a long passage from a life
of Mohammed written early in the eighteenth century by Boulainvilliers,
whom he calls, &lsquo;un des plus beaux génies de France.&rsquo; If this is an
accurate description, those who have read the works of Boulainvilliers
will think that France was badly off for men of genius; and as to his
life of Mohammed, it is little better than a romance: the author was
ignorant of Arabic, and knew nothing which had not been already
communicated by Maracci and Pococke. See <i>Biographie Universelle</i>, vol.
v. p. 321.</p>

<p>In regard to the later Arabian astronomers, one of their great merits
was to approximate to the value of the annual precession much closer
than Ptolemy had done. See <i>Grant's History of Physical Astronomy</i>, 1852,

sensible writer, and a man too of considerable learning: &lsquo;As to the
physical knowledge of the Egyptians, their cotemporaries gave them
credit for the astonishing power of their magic; and as we cannot
suppose that the instances recorded in Scripture were to be attributed
to the exertion of supernatural powers, we must conclude that they were
in possession of a more intimate knowledge of the laws and combinations
of nature than what is professed by the most learned men of the present
age.&rsquo; <i>Hamilton's Ægyptiaca</i>, pp. 61, 62. It is a shame that such
nonsense should be written in the nineteenth century: and yet a still
more recent author (<i>Vyse on the Pyramids</i>, vol. i. p. 28) assures us
that &lsquo;the Egyptians, for especial purposes, were endowed with great
wisdom and science.&rsquo; Science properly so called, the Egyptians had none;
and as to their wisdom, it was considerable enough to distinguish them
from barbarous nations like the old Hebrews, but it was inferior to that
of the Greeks, and it was of course immeasurably below that of modern
Europe.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_57_57" id="Footnote_57_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> Indeed many of them are still unknown; for, as M. Rey
justly observes, most writers pay too exclusive an attention to the
production of wealth, and neglect the laws of its distribution. <i>Rey</i>,
<i>Science Sociale</i>, vol. iii. p. 271. In confirmation of this, I may
mention the theory of rent, which was only discovered about half a
century ago, and which is connected with so many subtle arguments that
it is not yet generally adopted; and even some of its advocates have
shown themselves unequal to defending their own cause. The great law of
the ratio between the cost of labour and the profits of stock, is the
highest generalization we have reached respecting the distribution of
wealth; but it cannot be consistently admitted by anyone who holds that
rent enters into price.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> In a still more advanced stage, there is a fourth division
of wealth, and part of the produce of labour is absorbed by rent. This,
however, is not an element of price, but a consequence of it; and in the
ordinary march of affairs, considerable time must elapse before it can
begin. Rent, in the proper sense of the word, is the price paid for
using the natural and indestructible powers of the soil, and must not be
confused with rent commonly so called; for this last also includes the
profits of stock. I notice this, because several of the opponents of
Ricardo have placed the beginning of rent too early, by overlooking the
fact that apparent rent is very often profits disguised.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> &lsquo;Wages depend, then, on the proportion between the number
of the labouring population, and the capital or other funds devoted to
the purchase of labour; we will say, for shortness, the capital. If
wages are higher at one time or place than at another, if the
subsistence and comfort of the class of hired labourers are more ample,
it is, and can be, for no other reason than because capital bears a
greater proportion to population. It is not the absolute amount of
accumulation or of production that is of importance to the labouring
class; it is not the amount even of the funds destined for distribution
among the labourers; it is the proportion between those funds and the
numbers among whom they are shared. The condition of the class can be
bettered in no other way than by altering that proportion to their
advantage; and every scheme for their benefit which does not proceed on
this as its foundation, is, for all permanent purposes, a delusion.&rsquo;

vol. ii. pp. 264, 265, and <i>M'Culloch's Political Economy</i>, pp. 379,
380. Ricardo, in his <i>Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn</i>,
has stated, with his usual terseness, the three possible forms of this
question: &lsquo;The rise or fall of wages is common to all states of society,
whether it be the stationary, the advancing, or the retrograde state. In
the stationary state, it is regulated wholly by the increase or
falling-off of the population. In the advancing state, it depends on
whether the capital or the population advance at the more rapid course.
In the retrograde state, it depends on whether population or capital
decrease with the greater rapidity.&rsquo; <i>Ricardo's Works</i>, p. 379.</p></div>

said to have been first pointed out by Magendie. See <i>Müller's

authorities. See, for instance, <i>Liebig's Animal Chemistry</i>, p. 134;
<i>Carpenter's Human Physiology</i>, p. 685; <i>Brande's Chemistry</i>, vol. ii.
pp. 1218, 1870. The first tables of food constructed according to it
were by Boussingault; see an elaborate essay by Messrs. Lawes and
Gilbert on <i>The Composition of Foods</i>, in <i>Report of British Association
for 1852</i>, p. 323: but the experiments made by these gentlemen are
neither numerous nor diversified enough to establish a general law;

undergoing combustion.&rsquo; <i>Liebig's Letters on Chemistry</i>, p. 372.</p></div>

some substances is still imperfectly understood, and until late in the
eighteenth century, its existence was hardly suspected. It is now known
to be connected with the general theory of poisons. See <i>Turner's
Chemistry</i>, vol. i. p. 516. To this we must probably ascribe the fact
that several poisons which are fatal when applied to a wounded surface,
may be taken into the stomach with impunity. <i>Brodie's Physiological
Researches</i>, 1851, pp. 137, 138. It seems more reasonable to refer this
to chemical laws than to hold, with Sir Benjamin Brodie, that some
poisons &lsquo;destroy life by paralysing the muscles of respiration without
immediately affecting the action of the heart.&rsquo;</p></div>

albuminous, appears to me of much inferior value, though I observe that
it is adopted in the last edition of <i>Elliotson's Human Physiology</i>, pp.

between exertion and decay, is now almost complete. In regard to the
muscular system, see <i>Carpenter's Human Physiology</i>, pp.
440, 441, 581, edit. 1846: &lsquo;there is strong reason to believe the waste
or decomposition of the muscular tissue to be in exact proportion to the
degree in which it is exerted.&rsquo; This perhaps would be generally
anticipated even in the absence of direct proof; but what is more
interesting, is that the same principle holds good of the nervous
system. The human brain of an adult contains about one and a half per
cent of phosphorus; and it has been ascertained, that after the mind
has been much exercised, phosphates are excreted, and that in the case
of inflammation of the brain their excretion (by the kidneys) is very
considerable. See <i>Paget's Lectures on Surgical Pathology</i>, 1853, vol.

phosphorus of the brain the recent very able work of MM. Robin et
Verdeil, <i>Chimie Anatomique</i>, vol. i. p. 215, vol. ii. p. 348, Paris,
1853. According to these writers (vol. iii. p. 445), its existence in

usually the more pressing; and it has been ascertained by experiment,
what we should expect from theory, that when animals are starved to
death, there is a progressive decline in the temperature of their
bodies; so that the proximate cause of death by starvation is not
weakness, but cold. See <i>Williams's Principles of Medicine</i>, p. 36; and
on the connexion between the loss of animal heat and the appearance of
<i>rigor mortis</i> in the contractile parts of the body, see <i>Vogel's

be supposed that this combination took place in the lungs; but more
careful experiments have made it probable that the oxygen unites with
the carbon in the circulation, and that the blood-corpuscules are the
carriers of the oxygen. Compare <i>Liebig's Animal Chemistry</i>, p. 78;
<i>Letters on Chemistry</i>, pp. 335, 336; <i>Turner's Chemistry</i>, vol. ii. p.
1319; <i>Müller's Physiology</i>, vol. i. pp. 92, 159. That the combination
does not take place in the air-cells is moreover proved by the fact that
the lungs are not hotter than other parts of the body. See <i>Müller</i>,
vol. i. p. 348; <i>Thomson's Animal Chemistry</i>, p. 633; and <i>Brodie's
Physiol. Researches</i>, p. 33. Another argument in favour of the red
corpuscules being the carriers of oxygen, is that they are most abundant
in those classes of the vertebrata which maintain the highest
temperature; while the blood of invertebrata contains very few of them;
and it has been doubted if they even exist in the lower articulata and
mollusca. See <i>Carpenter's Human Physiol.</i> pp. 109, 532; <i>Grant's
Comparative Anatomy</i>, p. 472; <i>Elliotson's Human Physiol.</i> p. 159. In
regard to the different dimensions of corpuscules, see <i>Henle</i>,
<i>Anatomie Générale</i>, vol. i. pp. 457&ndash;467, 494, 495; <i>Blainville</i>,

above all, the important observations of Mr. Gulliver (<i>Carpenter</i>, pp.
105, 106). These additions to our knowledge, besides being connected
with the laws of animal heat and of nutrition, will, when generalized,
assist speculative minds in raising pathology to a science. In the mean
time I may mention the relation between an examination of the
corpuscules and the theory of inflammation which Hunter and Broussais
were unable to settle: this is, that the proximate cause of inflammation
is the obstruction of the vessels by the adhesion of the pale
corpuscules. Respecting this striking generalization, which is still on
its trial, compare <i>Williams's Principles of Medicine</i>, 1848, pp.
258&ndash;265, with <i>Paget's Surgical Pathology</i>, 1853, vol. i. pp. 313&ndash;317;
<i>Jones and Sieveking's Pathological Anatomy</i>, 1854, pp. 28, 105, 106. The
difficulties connected with the scientific study of inflammation are
evaded in <i>Vogel's Pathological Anatomy</i>, p. 418; a work which appears
to me to have been greatly overrated.</p></div>

also certain that exercise increases the number of respirations; and

than any others. <i>Milne Edwards</i>, <i>Zoologie</i>, part i. p. 88, part ii. p.

<p>If we now put these facts together, their bearing on the propositions in
the text will become evident; because, on the whole, there is more
exercise taken in cold climates than in hot ones, and there must
therefore be an increased respiratory action. For proof that greater
exercise is both taken and required, compare <i>Wrangel's Polar
Expedition</i>, pp. 79, 102; <i>Richardson's Arctic Expedition</i>, vol. i. p.
385; <i>Simpson's North Coast of America</i>, pp. 49,88, which should be
contrasted with the contempt for such amusements in hot countries.
Indeed, in polar regions all this is so essential to preserve a normal
state, that scurvy can only be kept off in the northern part of the
American continent by taking considerable exercise: see <i>Crantz</i>, <i>History
of Greenland</i>, vol. i. pp. 46, 62, 338.</p></div>

vegetable kingdom there is, however, so much carbon, that its
predominance, accompanied with the rarity of nitrogen, has induced
chemical botanists to characterize plants as carbonized, and animals as
azotized. But we have here to attend to a double antithesis. Vegetables
are carbonized in so far as they are non-azotized; but they are oxidized
in opposition to the highly carbonized animal food of cold countries.
Besides this, it is important to observe that the carbon of vegetables
is most abundant in the woody and unnutritious part, which is not
eaten; while the carbon of animals is found in the fatty and oily parts,
which are not only eaten, but are, in cold countries, greedily
devoured.</p></div>

labourers, the result would be under this sum&mdash;<i>Fourpence</i> a day for the

in his otherwise just remarks on the Irish, entirely overlook the effect
produced on their wages by the increase of population. <i>Kay's Social
Condition of the People</i>, vol. i. pp. 8, 9, 92, 223, 306&ndash;324. This is
the more observable, because the disadvantages of cheap food have been
noticed not only by several common writers, but by the highest of all
authorities on population, Mr. Malthus: see the sixth edition
of his <i>Essay on Population</i>, vol. i. p. 469, vol. ii. pp. 123, 124,
383, 384. If these things were oftener considered, we should not hear so
much about the idleness and levity of the Celtic race; the simple fact
being, that the Irish are unwilling to work, not because they are Celts,
but because their work is badly paid. When they go abroad, they get good
wages, and therefore they become as industrious as any other people.
Compare <i>Journal of Statistical Society</i>, vol. vii. p. 24, with
<i>Thornton on Over-Population</i>, p. 425; a very valuable work. Even in
1799, it was observed that the Irish as soon as they left their own
country became industrious and energetic. See <i>Parliamentary History</i>,

work hard.&rsquo; <i>Lyell's Second Visit to the United States</i>, 1849, vol. i.

<p><a name="Footnote_90_90" id="Footnote_90_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> In a recent work of considerable ingenuity (<i>Doubleday's
True Law of Population</i>, 1847, pp. 25&ndash;29, 69, 78, 123, 124, &amp;c.) it is
noticed that countries are more populous when the ordinary food is
vegetable than when it is animal; and an attempt is made to explain this
on the ground that a poor diet is more favourable to fecundity than a
rich one. But though the fact of the greater increase of population is
indisputable, there are several reasons for being dissatisfied with Mr.
Doubleday's explanation.</p>

<p>1st. That the power of propagation is heightened by poor living, is a
proposition which has never been established physiologically; while the
observations of travellers and of governments are not sufficiently
numerous to establish it statistically.</p>

<p>2nd. Vegetable diet is as generous for a hot country as animal diet is
for a cold country; and since we know that, notwithstanding the
difference of food and climate, the temperature of the body varies
little between the equator and the poles (compare <i>Liebig's Animal
Chemistry</i>, p. 19; <i>Holland's Medical Notes</i>, p. 473; <i>Pouillet</i>,
<i>Elémens de Physique</i>, vol. i. part i. p. 414; <i>Burdach's Traité de
Physiologie</i>, vol. ix. p. 663), we have no reason to believe that there
is any other normal variation, but should rather suppose that, in regard
to all essential functions, vegetable diet and external heat are
equivalent to animal diet and external cold.</p>

<p>3rd. Even conceding, for the sake of argument, that vegetable food
increases the procreative power, this would only affect the number of
births, and not the density of population; for a greater number of
births may be, and often are, remedied by a greater mortality; a point
in regard to which Godwin, in trying to refute Malthus, falls into
serious error. <i>Godwin on Population</i>, p. 317.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, I have found that these views of Mr.
Doubleday's were in a great measure anticipated by Fourier. See <i>Rey</i>,
<i>Science Sociale</i>; vol. i. p. 185.</p></div>

evidence has become still more precise and extensive; and is, I think,

travelled westward. Besides the historical evidence, there are
philological probabilities in favour of its being indigenous to Asia,
and the Sanscrit name for it has been very widely diffused. Compare
<i>Humboldt's Cosmos</i>, vol. ii. p. 472, with <i>Crawfurd's History of the
Indian Archipelago</i>, vol. i. p. 358. In the fourteenth century, it was
the common food on the Zanguebar Coast; and is now universal in

its seeds were, according to <i>M'Culloch's Dictionary of Commerce</i>, p.
1105, carried to Carolina late in the seventeenth century. It is now
cultivated in Nicaragua (<i>Squier's Central America</i>, vol. i. p. 38) and
in South America (<i>Henderson's Hist. of Brazil</i>, pp. 292, 307, 395, 440,

Plants</i>, pp. 291, 297, with <i>Azara</i>, <i>Voyages dans l'Amérique
Méridionale</i>, vol. i. p. 100, vol. ii. p. 80. The ancient Greeks,
though acquainted with rice, did not cultivate it; and its cultivation
was first introduced into Europe by the Arabs. See <i>Humboldt</i>, <i>Nouvelle

<i>Works</i>, p. 65) says, &lsquo;whatever increases wages, necessarily reduces
profits.&rsquo; And in chap. xv. p. 122, &lsquo;whatever raises the wages of labour,
lowers the profits of stock.&rsquo; In several other places he makes the same
assertion, very much to the discomfort of the ordinary reader, who knows
that in the United States, for instance, wages and profits are both
high. But the ambiguity is in the language, not in the thought; and in
these and similar passages Ricardo by wages meant cost of labour, in
which sense the proposition is quite accurate. If by wages we mean the
reward of labour, then there is no relation between wages and profits;
for when rent is low, both of them may be high, as is the case in the
United States. That this was the view of Ricardo is evident from the
following passage: &lsquo;Profits, it cannot be too often repeated, depend on
wages; not on nominal but real wages; not on the number of pounds that
may be annually paid to the labourer, but on the number of days' work
necessary to obtain those pounds.&rsquo; <i>Political Economy</i>, chap. vii.,

notwithstanding these variations, there must be in every country an

<p>On the other hand, the riches possessed by the upper classes have, owing
to this mal-distribution of wealth, been always enormous, and sometimes
incredible. See <i>Forbes's Oriental Memoirs</i>, vol. ii. p. 297; <i>Bohlen</i>,

Jehangueir contains such extraordinary statements of his immense wealth,
that the Editor, Major Price, thinks that some error must have been made
by the copyist; but the reader will find in <i>Grote's History of Greece</i>
(vol. xii. pp. 229, 245) evidence of the treasures which it was possible
for Asiatic rulers to collect in that state of society. The working of
this unequal distribution is thus stated by Mr. Glyn (<i>Transac. of
Asiatic Society</i>, vol. i. p. 482): &lsquo;The nations of Europe have very
little idea of the actual condition of the inhabitants of Hindustan;
they are more wretchedly poor than we have any notion of. Europeans have
hitherto been too apt to draw their opinions of the wealth of Hindustan
from the gorgeous pomp of a few emperors, sultans, nawabs, and rajahs;
whereas a more intimate and accurate view of the real state of society
would have shown that these princes and nobles were engrossing all the
wealth of the country, whilst the great body of the people were earning
but a bare subsistence, groaning under intolerable burdens, and hardly
able to supply themselves with the necessaries of life, much less with
its luxuries.&rsquo;</p></div>

people will forcibly appear, when we recollect how little is necessary
for the subsistence of a peasant in these regions. The value of this can
seldom amount to more than one penny per day, even allowing him to make
his meal of two pounds of boiled rice, with a due proportion of salt,
oil, vegetables, fish, and chili.&rsquo; <i>Turner's Embassy to Tibet</i>, p. 11.

comprise the whole of the working classes; the Vaisyas not being
husbandmen, as they are often called, but landlords, owners of cattle,
and traders. Compare <i>Institutes of Menu</i>, chap. ix. sec. 326&ndash;333, in

be mentioned, that from the high-palm there is prepared a peculiar

is a black basalt, of great hardness, which, with the best of modern
tools, can only be cut with difficulty.&rsquo; Mr. Stephens (<i>Central

and models for study.&rsquo; See also vol. iii. pp. 276, 389, 406, vol. iv. p.
293. Of the paintings at Chichen he says (vol. iv. p. 311), &lsquo;they
exhibit a freedom of touch which could only be the result of discipline
and training under masters.&rsquo; At Copan (vol. i. p. 151), &lsquo;it would be
impossible, with the best instruments of modern times, to cut stones
more perfectly.&rsquo; And at Uxmal (vol. ii. p. 431), &lsquo;throughout, the laying
and polishing of the stones are as perfect as under the rules of the
best modern masonry.&rsquo; Our knowledge of Central America is almost
entirely derived from these two writers; and although the work of Mr.
Stephens is much the more minute, Mr. Squier says (vol. ii. p. 306),
what I believe is quite true, that until the appearance of his own book
in 1853, the monuments in Nicaragua were entirely unknown. Short
descriptions of the remains in Guatemala and Yucatan will be found in

geographical distribution of plants, see <i>Henslow's Botany</i>, pp.
295&ndash;300, and <i>Balfour's Botany</i>, pp. 560&ndash;563. Meyen (<i>Geog. of Plants</i>,
p. 263) says, &lsquo;I, therefore, after allowing for local circumstances,
bring the vegetation of islands also under the law of nature, according
to which the number of species constantly increases with increasing heat
and corresponding humidity.&rsquo; On the effect of temperature alone, compare
a note in <i>Erman's Siberia</i>, vol. i. pp. 64, 65, with <i>Reports on Botany
by the Ray Society</i>, pp. 339, 340. In the latter work, it is supposed
that heat is the most important of all single agents; and though this is
probably true, still the influence of humidity is immense. I may mention
as an instance of this, that it has been recently ascertained that the
oxygen used by seeds during germination, is not always taken from the
air, but is obtained by decomposing water. See the curious experiments
of Edwards and Colin in <i>Lindley's Botany</i>, vol. ii. pp. 261, 262,
London, 1848; and on the direct nourishment which water supplies to
vegetables, see Burdache's great work, <i>Traité de Physiologie</i>, vol. ix.

those vibrations of the earth, instead of becoming habituated to them,
as persons do who are constantly exposed to other dangers, they become
more filled with dismay every time the shock is repeated, so that aged

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_240_240" id="Footnote_240_240"></a><a href="#FNanchor_240_240"><span class="label">[240]</span></a> Under the influence of the inductive philosophy, the
theological theory of disease was seriously weakened before the middle
of the seventeenth century; and by the middle, or at all events the
latter half, of the eighteenth century, it had lost all its partisans
among scientific men. At present it still lingers on among the vulgar;
and traces of it may be found in the writings of the clergy, and in the
works of other persons little acquainted with physical knowledge. When
the cholera broke out in England, attempts were made to revive the old
notion; but the spirit of the age was too strong for such efforts to
succeed; and it may be safely predicted that men will never return to
their former opinions, unless they first return to their former
ignorance. As a specimen of the ideas which the cholera tended to
excite, and of their antagonism to all scientific investigation, I may
refer to a letter written in 1832 by Mrs. Grant, a woman of some
accomplishments, and not devoid of influence (<i>Correspondence of Mrs.
Grant</i>, London, 1844, vol. iii. pp. 216, 217), where she states that &lsquo;it
appears to me great presumption to indulge so much as people do in
speculation and conjecture about a disease so evidently a peculiar
infliction, and different from all other modes of suffering hitherto
known.&rsquo; This desire to limit human speculation is precisely the feeling
which long retained Europe in darkness; since it effectually prevented
those free inquiries to which we are indebted for all the real knowledge
we possess. The doubts of Boyle upon this subject supply a curious
instance of the transitory state through which the mind was passing in
the seventeenth century, and by which the way was prepared for the great
liberating movement of the next age. Boyle, after stating both sides of
the question, namely, the theological and the scientific, adds, &lsquo;and it
is the less likely that these sweeping and contagious maladies should be
always sent for the punishment of impious men, because I remember to
have read in good authors, that as some plagues destroyed both men and
beasts, so some other did peculiarly destroy brute animals of very
little consideration or use to men, as cats,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Upon these and the like reasons, I have sometimes suspected that in the
controversy about the origin of the plague, namely, whether it be
natural or supernatural, neither of the contending parties is altogether
in the right; since it is very possible that some pestilences may not
break forth without an extraordinary, though perhaps not immediate,
interposition of Almighty God, provoked by the sins of men; and yet
other plagues may be produced by a tragical concourse of merely natural
causes.&rsquo; <i>Discourse on the Air</i>, in <i>Boyle's Works</i>, vol. iv. pp. 288,
289. &lsquo;<i>Neither of the contending parties is altogether in the
right!</i>&rsquo;&mdash;an instructive passage towards understanding the compromising
spirit of the seventeenth century; standing midway, as it did, between
the credulity of the sixteenth, and the scepticism of the eighteenth.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">EXAMINATION OF THE METHOD EMPLOYED BY METAPHYSICIANS FOR
DISCOVERING MENTAL LAWS.</div>

<p>The evidence that I have collected seems to establish
two leading facts, which, unless they can be impugned,
are the necessary basis of universal history. The first
fact is, that in the civilizations out of Europe, the
powers of nature have been far greater than in those in
Europe. The second fact is, that those powers have
worked immense mischief; and that while one division
of them has caused an unequal distribution of wealth,
another division of them has caused an unequal distribution
of thought, by concentrating attention upon
subjects which inflame the imagination. So far as the
experience of the past can guide us, we may say, that
in all the extra European civilizations, these obstacles
are insuperable: certainly no nation has ever yet overcome
them. But Europe, being constructed upon a
smaller plan than the other quarters of the world&mdash;being
also in a colder region, having a less exuberant
soil, a less imposing aspect, and displaying in all her
physical phenomena much greater feebleness&mdash;it was
easier for Man to discard the superstitions which
Nature suggested to his imagination; and it was also
easier for him to effect, not, indeed, a just division of
wealth, but something nearer to it, than was practicable
in the older countries.</p>

<p>Hence it is that, looking at the history of the world
as a whole, the tendency has been, in Europe, to subordinate
nature to man; out of Europe, to subordinate
man to nature. To this there are, in barbarous
countries, several exceptions; but in civilized countries
the rule has been universal. The great division, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
between European civilization and non-European
civilization, is the basis of the philosophy of history,
since it suggests the important consideration, that if
we would understand, for instance, the history of India,
we must make the external world our first study,
because it has influenced man more than man has
influenced it. If, on the other hand, we would understand
the history of a country like France or England,
we must make man our principal study, because nature
being comparatively weak, every step in the great progress
has increased the dominion of the human mind
over the agencies of the external world. Even in those
countries where the power of man has reached the
highest point, the pressure of nature is still immense;
but it diminishes in each succeeding generation, because
our increasing knowledge enables us not so much to
control nature as to foretell her movements, and thus
obviate many of the evils she would otherwise occasion.
How successful our efforts have been, is evident from
the fact, that the average duration of life constantly
becomes longer, and the number of inevitable dangers
fewer; and what makes this the more remarkable is,
that the curiosity of men is keener, and their contact
with each other closer, than in any former period; so
that while apparent hazards are multiplied, we find
from experience that real hazards are, on the whole,
diminished.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>If, therefore, we take the largest possible view of
the history of Europe, and confine ourselves entirely
to the primary cause of its superiority over other
parts of the world, we must resolve it into the encroachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of the mind of man upon the organic and inorganic
forces of nature. To this all other causes are subordinate.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
For we have seen that wherever the powers
of nature reached a certain height, the national civilization
was irregularly developed, and the advance of the
civilization stopped. The first essential was, to limit
the interference of these physical phenomena; and that
was most likely to be accomplished where the phenomena
were feeblest and least imposing. This was the
case with Europe; it is accordingly in Europe alone,
that man has really succeeded in taming the energies
of nature, bending them to his own will, turning them
aside from their ordinary course, and compelling them
to minister to his happiness, and subserve the general
purposes of human life.</p>

<p>All around us are the traces of this glorious and successful
struggle. Indeed, it seems as if in Europe there
was nothing man feared to attempt. The invasions of
the sea repelled, and whole provinces, as in the case of
Holland, rescued from its grasp, mountains cut through
and turned into level roads; soils of the most obstinate
sterility becoming exuberant, from the mere advance
of chemical knowledge; while, in regard to electric
phenomena, we see the subtlest, the most rapid, and
the most mysterious of all forces, made the medium of
thought, and obeying even the most capricious behests of
the human mind.</p>

<p>In other instances, where the products of the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
world have been refractory, man has succeeded in destroying
what he could hardly hope to subjugate. The
most cruel diseases, such as the plague, properly so
called, and the leprosy of the Middle Ages,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> have entirely
disappeared from the civilized parts of Europe;
and it is scarcely possible that they should ever again
be seen there. Wild beasts and birds of prey have
been extirpated, and are no longer allowed to infest the
haunts of civilised men. Those frightful famines, by
which Europe used to be ravaged several times in
every century,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> have ceased; and so successfully have
we grappled with them, that there is not the slightest
fear of their ever returning with any thing like their
former severity. Indeed, our resources are now so
great, that we could at worst, only suffer from a slight
and temporary scarcity: since, in the present state of
knowledge, the evil would be met at the outset by
remedies which chemical science could easily suggest.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to notice how, in numerous
other instances, the progress of European civilization has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
been marked by the diminished influence of the external
world: I mean, of course, those peculiarities of the external
world which have an existence independent of the
wishes of man, and were not created by him. The most
advanced nations do, in their present state, owe comparatively
little to those original features of nature which,
in every civilization out of Europe, exercised unlimited
power. Thus, in Asia and elsewhere, the course of trade,
the extent of commerce, and many similar circumstances,
were determined by the existence of rivers, by the facility
with which they could be navigated, and by the number
and goodness of the adjoining harbours. But, in Europe,
the determining cause is, not so much these physical peculiarities,
as the skill and energy of man. Formerly the
richest countries were those in which nature was most
bountiful; now the richest countries are those in which
man is most active. For, in our age of the world, if nature
is parsimonious, we know how to compensate her deficiencies.
If a river is difficult to navigate, or a country
difficult to traverse, our engineers can correct the error,
and remedy the evil. If we have no rivers, we make
canals; if we have no natural harbours, we make artificial
ones. And so marked is this tendency to impair the authority
of natural phenomena, that it is seen even in the
distribution of the people, since, in the most civilized
parts of Europe, the population of the towns is everywhere
outstripping that of the country; and it is evident
that the more men congregate in great cities, the more
they will become accustomed to draw their materials of
thought from the business of human life, and the less
attention they will pay to those peculiarities of nature,
which are the fertile source of superstition, and by
which, in every civilization out of Europe, the progress
of man was arrested.</p>

<p>From these facts it may be fairly inferred, that the
advance of European civilization is characterized by a
diminishing influence of physical laws, and an increasing
influence of mental laws. The complete proof of this
generalization can be collected only from history; and
therefore I must reserve a large share of the evidence on
which it is founded for the future volumes of this work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
But that the proposition is fundamentally true must be
admitted by whoever, in addition to the arguments just
adduced, will concede two premiss is, neither of which
seem susceptible of much dispute. The first premiss is,
that we are in possession of no evidence that the powers
of nature have ever been permanently increased; and that
we have no reason to expect that any such increase can
take place. The other premiss is, that we have abundant
evidence that the resources of the human mind have
become more powerful, more numerous, and more able to
grapple with the difficulties of the external world; because
every fresh accession to our knowledge supplies
fresh means with which we can either control the operations
of nature, or, failing in that, can foresee the consequences,
and thus avoid what it is impossible to prevent;
in both instances, diminishing the pressure exercised on
us by external agents.</p>

<p>If these premisses are admitted, we are led to a conclusion
which is of great value for the purpose of this
Introduction. For, if the measure of civilization is the
triumph of the mind over external agents, it becomes
clear, that of the two classes of laws which regulate the
progress of mankind, the mental class is more important
than the physical. This, indeed, is assumed by one
school of thinkers as a matter of course, though I am not
aware that its demonstration has been hitherto attempted
by any thing even approaching an exhaustive analysis.
The question, however, as to the originality of my arguments,
is one of very trifling moment; but what we have
to notice is, that in the present stage of our inquiry, the
problem with which we started has become simplified,
and a discovery of the laws of European history is
resolved, in the first instance, into a discovery of the
laws of the human mind. These mental laws, when
ascertained, will be the ultimate basis of the history
of Europe; the physical laws will be treated as of minor
importance, and as merely giving rise to disturbances,
the force and the frequency of which have, during
several centuries, perceptibly diminished.</p>

<p>If we now inquire into the means of discovering the
laws of the human mind, the metaphysicians are ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
with an answer; and they refer us to their own labours
as supplying a satisfactory solution. It therefore becomes
necessary to ascertain the value of their researches, to
measure the extent of their resources, and, above all, to
test the validity of that method which they always follow,
and by which alone, as they assert, great truths can be
elicited.</p>

<p>The metaphysical method, though necessarily branching
into two divisions, is, in its origin, always the same,
and consists in each observer studying the operations of
his own mind.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> This is the direct opposite of the historical
method; the metaphysician studying one mind,
the historian studying many minds. Now, the first
remark to make on this is, that the metaphysical method
is one by which no discovery has ever yet been made in
any branch of knowledge. Every thing we at present
know has been ascertained by studying phenomena, from
which all casual disturbances having been removed, the
law remains as a conspicuous residue.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> And this can
only be done by observations so numerous as to eliminate
the disturbances, or else by experiments so delicate as
to isolate the phenomena. One of these conditions is
essential to all inductive science; but neither of them
does the metaphysician obey. To isolate the phenomenon
is for him an impossibility; since no man, into whatever
state of reverie he may be thrown, can entirely cut
himself off from the influence of external events, which
must produce an effect on his mind, even when he is
unconscious of their presence. As to the other condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
it is by the metaphysician set at open defiance; for
his whole system is based on the supposition that, by
studying a single mind, he can get the laws of all minds;
so that while he, on the one hand, is unable to isolate his
observations from disturbances, he, on the other hand,
refuses to adopt the only remaining precaution&mdash;he refuses
so to enlarge his survey as to eliminate the disturbances
by which his observations are troubled.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>This is the first and fundamental objection to which
metaphysicians are exposed, even on the threshold of
their science. But if we penetrate a little deeper, we
shall meet with another circumstance, which, though
less obvious, is equally decisive. After the metaphysician
has taken for granted that, by studying one mind, he can
discover the laws of all minds, he finds himself involved
in a singular difficulty as soon as he begins to apply even
this imperfect method. The difficulty to which I allude
is one which, not being met with in any other pursuit,
seems to have escaped the attention of those who are
unacquainted with metaphysical controversies. To understand,
therefore, its nature, it is requisite to give a
short account of those two great schools, to one of which
all metaphysicians must necessarily belong.</p>

<p>In investigating the nature of the human mind,
according to the metaphysical scheme, there are two
methods of proceeding, both of which are equally obvious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and yet both of which lead to entirely different results.
According to the first method, the inquirer begins by
examining his sensations. According to the other method,
he begins by examining his ideas. These two
methods always have led, and always must lead, to conclusions
diametrically opposed to each other. Nor are
the reasons of this difficult to understand. In metaphysics,
the mind is the instrument as well as the material on
which the instrument is employed. The means by which
the science must be worked out, being thus the same as
the object upon which it works, there arises a difficulty
of a very peculiar kind. This difficulty is, the impossibility
of taking a comprehensive view of the whole of
the mental phenomena; because, however extensive such
a view may be, it must exclude the state of the mind by
which, or in which, the view itself is taken. Hence we
may perceive what, I think, is a fundamental difference
between physical and metaphysical inquiries. In physics,
there are several methods of proceeding, all of which lead
to the same results. But in metaphysics, it will invariably
be found, that if two men of equal ability, and equal
honesty, employ different methods in the study of the
mind, the conclusions which they obtain will also be
different. To those who are unversed in these matters, a
few illustrations will set this in a clearer light. Metaphysicians
who begin by the study of ideas observe in
their own minds an idea of space. Whence, they ask,
can this arise? It cannot, they say, owe its origin to
the senses, because the senses only supply what is finite
and contingent; whereas the idea of space is infinite
and necessary.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> It is infinite, since we cannot conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that space has an end; and it is necessary, since we cannot
conceive the possibility of its non-existence. Thus
far the idealist. But the sensualist, as he is called,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>&mdash;he
who begins, not with ideas, but with sensations,
arrives at a very different conclusion. He remarks that
we can have no idea of space until we have first had an
idea of objects; and that the ideas of objects can only be
the results of the sensations which those objects excite.
As to the idea of space being necessary, this, he says,
only results from the circumstance that we never can
perceive an object which does not bear a certain position
to some other object. This forms an indissoluble association
between the idea of position and the idea of an
object; and as this association is constantly repeated
before us, we at length find ourselves unable to conceive
an object without position, or, in other words, without
space.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> As to space being infinite, this, he says, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
notion we get by conceiving a continual addition to lines,
or to surfaces, or to bulk, which are the three modifications
of extension.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> On innumerable other points we
find the same discrepancy between the two schools. The
idealist,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> for example, asserts that our notions of cause,
of time, of personal identity, and of substance, are universal
and necessary; that they are simple; and that not
being susceptible of analysis, they must be referred to
the original constitution of the mind.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> On the other
hand, the sensationalist, so far from recognizing the simplicity
of these ideas, considers them to be extremely
complex, and looks upon their universality and necessity
as merely the result of a frequent and intimate
association.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>This is the first important difference which is inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
consequent on the adoption of different methods.
The idealist is compelled to assert, that necessary truths
and contingent truths have a different origin.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The sensationalist
is bound to affirm that they have the same
origin.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> The further these two great schools advance,
the more marked does their divergence become. They
are at open war in every department of morals, of philosophy,
and of art. The idealists say that all men have
essentially the same notion of the good, the true, and
the beautiful. The sensationalists affirm that there is no
such standard, because ideas depend upon sensations,
and because the sensations of men depend upon the
changes in their bodies, and upon the external events
by which their bodies are affected.</p>

<p>Such is a short specimen of the opposite conclusions
to which the ablest metaphysicians have been driven,
by the simple circumstance that they have pursued
opposite methods of investigation. And this is the more
important to observe, because, after these two methods
have been employed, the resources of metaphysics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
are evidently exhausted.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Both parties agree that
mental laws can only be discovered by studying individual
minds, and that there is nothing in the mind
which is not the result either of reflection or of
sensation. The only choice, therefore, they have
to make, is between subordinating the results of
sensation to the laws of reflection, or else subordinating
the results of reflection to the laws of sensation.
Every system of metaphysics has been constructed
according to one of these schemes; and this must
always continue to be the case, because, when the two
schemes are added together, they include the totality
of metaphysical phenomena. Each process is equally
plausible;<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> the supporters of each are equally confident;
and, by the very nature of the dispute, it is
impossible that any middle term should be found; nor
can there ever be an umpire, because no one can
mediate between metaphysical controversies without
being a metaphysician, and no one can be a metaphysician
without being either a sensationalist or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
idealist; in other words, without belonging to one of
those very parties whose claims he professes to judge.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>On these grounds, we must, I think, arrive at the
conclusion, that as metaphysicians are unavoidably, and
by the very nature of their inquiry, broken up into
two completely antagonistic schools, the relative truth
of which there are no means of ascertaining; as they,
moreover, have but few resources, and as they use
those resources according to a method by which no
other science has ever been developed,&mdash;we, looking at
these things, ought not to expect that they can supply
us with sufficient data for solving those great problems
which the history of the human mind presents to our
view. And whoever will take the pains fairly to estimate
the present condition of mental philosophy, must
admit that, notwithstanding the influence it has always
exercised over some of the most powerful minds, and
through them over society at large, there is, nevertheless,
no other study which has been so zealously prosecuted,
so long continued, and yet remains so barren of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
results. In no other department has there been so
much movement, and so little progress. Men of
eminent abilities, and of the greatest integrity of purpose,
have in every civilized country, for many centuries,
been engaged in metaphysical inquiries; and yet
at the present moment their systems, so far from approximating
towards truth, are diverging from each
other with a velocity which seems to be accelerated by
the progress of knowledge. The incessant rivalry of
the hostile schools, the violence with which they have
been supported, and the exclusive and unphilosophic
confidence with which each has advocated its own
method,&mdash;all these things have thrown the study of
the mind into a confusion only to be compared to that
in which the study of religion has been thrown by the
controversies of the theologians.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> The consequence is,
that if we except a very few of the laws of association,
and perhaps I may add the modern theories of vision
and of touch,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> there is not to be found in the whole
compass of metaphysics a single principle of importance,
and at the same time of incontestable truth.
Under these circumstances, it is impossible to avoid a
suspicion that there is some fundamental error in the
manner in which these inquiries have been prosecuted.
For my own part, I believe that, by mere observation
of our own minds, and even by such rude experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
as we are able to make upon them, it will be impossible
to raise psychology to a science; and I entertain very
little doubt that metaphysics can only be successfully
studied by an investigation of history so comprehensive
as to enable us to understand the conditions which
govern the movements of the human race.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

purely metaphysical method of investigation. There is, however, a very
small number of metaphysicians, among whom M. Cousin is the most eminent
in France, in whose works we find larger views, and an attempt to
connect historical inquiries with metaphysical ones; thus recognizing
the necessity of verifying their original speculations. To this method
there can be no objection, provided the metaphysical conclusions are
merely regarded as hypothesis, which require verification to raise them
to theories. But, instead of this cautious proceeding, the almost
invariable plan is, to treat the hypothesis as if it were a theory
already proved, and as if there remained nothing to do but to give
historical illustrations of truths established by the psychologist. This
confusion between illustration and verification appears to be the
universal failing of those who, like Vico and Fichte, speculate upon
historical phenomena <i>à priori</i>.</p></div>

deserve notice from an eclectic historian of philosophy.</p>

is founded upon truth. To this confidence I have come, not merely
through the convictions of my own consciousness, but by finding in this
system a centre and conciliation for the most opposite of philosophical
opinions.&rsquo; But, at p. 589, he summarily disposes of one of the most
important of these philosophical opinions as &lsquo;the superficial edifice of

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">MENTAL LAWS ARE EITHER MORAL OR INTELLECTUAL. COMPARISON
OF MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL LAWS, AND INQUIRY INTO THE
EFFECT PRODUCED BY EACH ON THE PROGRESS OF SOCIETY.</div>

<p>In the preceding chapter, it has, I trust, been made
apparent, that, whatever may hereafter be the case, we,
looking merely at the present state of our knowledge,
must pronounce the metaphysical method to be unequal
to the task, often imposed upon it, of discovering the
laws which regulate the movements of the human mind.
We are, therefore, driven to the only remaining method,
according to which mental phenomena are to be studied,
not simply as they appear in the mind of the individual
observer, but as they appear in the actions of mankind at
large. The essential opposition between these two plans
is very obvious: but it may perhaps be well to bring
forward further illustration of the resources possessed
by each for the investigation of truth; and for this
purpose, I will select a subject which, though still imperfectly
understood, supplies a beautiful instance of
the regularity with which, under the most conflicting
circumstances, the great Laws of Nature are able to
hold their course.</p>

<p>The case to which I refer, is that of the proportion
kept up in the births of the sexes; a proportion which
if it were to be greatly disturbed in any country, even
for a single generation, would throw society into the
most serious confusion, and would infallibly cause a
great increase in the vices of the people.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Now, it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
always been suspected that, on an average, the male
and female births are tolerably equal; but, until very
recently, no one could tell whether or not they are
precisely equal, or, if unequal, on which side there is an
excess.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The births being the physical result of physical
antecedents, it was clearly seen that the laws of
the births must be in those antecedents; that is to say,
that the causes of the proportion of the sexes must
reside in the parents themselves.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Under these circumstances,
the question arose, if it was not possible to
elucidate this difficulty by our knowledge of animal
physiology; for it was plausibly said, &lsquo;Since physiology
is a study of the laws of the body,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and since all births<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
are products resulting from the body, it follows that if
we know the laws of the body, we shall know the laws
of the birth.&rsquo; This was the view taken by physiologists
of our origin;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and this is precisely the view taken by
metaphysicians of our history. Both parties believed
that it was possible at once to rise to the cause of the
phenomenon, and by studying its laws predict the phenomenon
itself. The physiologist said, &lsquo;By studying
individual bodies, and thus ascertaining the laws which
regulate the union of the parents, I will discover the
proportion of the sexes, because the proportion is
merely the result to which the union gives rise.&rsquo; Just
in the same way, the metaphysician says, &lsquo;By studying
individual minds, I will ascertain the laws which govern
their movements; and in that way I will predict the
movements of mankind, which are obviously compounded
of the individual movements.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> These are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
expectations which have been confidently held out, by
physiologists respecting the laws of the sexes, and by
metaphysicians respecting the laws of history. Towards
the fulfilment, however, of these promises the
metaphysicians have done absolutely nothing; nor have
the physiologists been more successful, although their
views have the support of anatomy, which admits of
the employment of direct experiment, a resource unknown
to metaphysics. But towards settling the present
question, all this availed them nothing; and physiologists
are not yet possessed of a single fact which
throws any light on this problem: Is the number of
male births equal to female births&mdash;is it greater, or is it
less?</p>

<p>These are questions to which all the resources of
physiologists, from Aristotle down to our own time,
afford no means of reply.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> And yet at the present day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
we, by the employment of what now seems a very
natural method, are possessed of a truth which the
united abilities of a long series of eminent men failed to
discover. By the simple experiment of registering the
number of births and their sexes; by extending this
registration over several years, in different countries,&mdash;we
have been able to eliminate all casual disturbances,
and ascertain the existence of a law which, expressed
in round numbers, is, that for every twenty girls there
are born twenty-one boys: and we may confidently
say, that although the operations of this law are of
course liable to constant aberrations, the law itself is so
powerful, that we know of no country in which during
a single year the male births have not been greater
than the female ones.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>The importance and the beautiful regularity of this
law make us regret that it still remains an empirical
truth, not having yet been connected with the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
phenomena by which its operations are caused.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> But
this is immaterial to my present purpose, which is only
to notice the method by which the discovery has been
made. For this method is obviously analogous to that
by which I propose to investigate the operations of the
human mind; while the old and unsuccessful method
is analogous to that employed by the metaphysicians.
As long as physiologists attempted to ascertain the
laws of the proportion of sexes by individual experiments,
they effected absolutely nothing towards the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
they hoped to achieve. But when men became dissatisfied
with these individual experiments, and instead of
them, began to collect observations less minute, but
more comprehensive, then it was that the great law of
nature, for which during many centuries they had
vainly searched, first became unfolded to their view.
Precisely in the same way, as long as the human mind
is only studied according to the narrow and contracted
method of metaphysicians, we have every reason for
thinking that the laws which regulate its movements
will remain unknown. If, therefore, we wish to effect
anything of real moment, it becomes necessary that we
should discard those old schemes, the insufficiency of
which is demonstrated by experience as well as by
reason; and that we should substitute in their place
such a comprehensive survey of facts as will enable us
to eliminate those disturbances which, owing to the
impossibility of experiment, we shall never be able to
isolate.</p>

<p>The desire that I feel to make the preliminary views
of this Introduction perfectly clear, is my sole apology
for having introduced a digression which, though adding
nothing to the strength of the argument, may be
found useful as illustrating it, and will at all events
enable ordinary readers to appreciate the value of the
proposed method. It now remains for us to ascertain
the manner in which, by the application of this
method, the laws of mental progress may be most easily
discovered.</p>

<p>If, in the first place, we ask what this progress is,
the answer seems very simple: that it is a two-fold
progress, Moral and Intellectual; the first having more
immediate relation to our duties, the second to our
knowledge. This is a classification which has been
frequently laid down, and with which most persons are
familiar. And so far as history is a narration of results,
there can be no doubt that the division is perfectly
accurate. There can be no doubt that a people
are not really advancing, if, on the one hand, their increasing
ability is accompanied by increasing vice, or
if, on the other hand, while they are becoming more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
virtuous, they likewise become more ignorant. This
double movement, moral and intellectual, is essential to
the very idea of civilization, and includes the entire
theory of mental progress. To be willing to perform
our duty is the moral part; to know how to perform it
is the intellectual part: while the closer these two
parts are knit together, the greater the harmony with
which they work; and the more accurately the means
are adapted to the end, the more completely will the
scheme of our life be accomplished, and the more
securely shall we lay a foundation for the further
advancement of mankind.</p>

<p>A question, therefore, now arises of great moment:
namely, which of these two parts or elements of mental
progress is the most important. For the progress itself
being the result of their united action, it becomes
necessary to ascertain which of them works more
powerfully, in order that we may subordinate the
inferior element to the laws of the superior one. If
the advance of civilization, and the general happiness
of mankind, depend more on their moral feelings than
on their intellectual knowledge, we must of course
measure the progress of society by those feelings;
while if, on the other hand, it depends principally on
their knowledge, we must take as our standard the
amount and success of their intellectual activity. As
soon as we know the relative energy of these two components,
we shall treat them according to the usual
plan for investigating truth; that is to say, we shall
look at the product of their joint action as obeying the
laws of the more powerful agent, whose operations are
casually disturbed by the inferior laws of the minor
agent.</p>

<p>In entering into this inquiry, we are met by a preliminary
difficulty, arising from the loose and careless
manner in which ordinary language is employed on
subjects that require the greatest nicety and precision.
For the expression, Moral and Intellectual Progress, is
suggestive of a serious fallacy. In the manner in
which it is generally used, it conveys an idea that the
moral and intellectual faculties of men are, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
advance of civilization, naturally more acute and more
trustworthy than they were formerly. But this, though
it may possibly be true, has never been proved. It may
be that, owing to some physical causes still unknown,
the average capacity of the brain is, if we compare long
periods of time, becoming gradually greater; and that
therefore the mind, which acts through the brain, is,
even independently of education, increasing in aptitude
and in the general competence of its views.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Such,
however, is still our ignorance of physical laws, and so
completely are we in the dark as to the circumstances
which regulate the hereditary transmission of character,
temperament,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> and other personal peculiarities, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
we must consider this alleged progress as a very doubtful
point; and, in the present state of our knowledge,
we cannot safely assume that there has been any permanent
improvement in the moral or intellectual
faculties of man, nor have we any decisive ground for
saying that those faculties are likely to be greater in
an infant born in the most civilized part of Europe,
than in one born in the wildest region of a barbarous
country.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>Whatever, therefore, the moral and intellectual progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of men may be, it resolves itself not into a progress
of natural capacity,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> but into a progress, if I
may so say, of opportunity; that is, an improvement in
the circumstances under which that capacity after
birth comes into play. Here, then, lies the gist of the
whole matter. The progress is one, not of internal
power, but of external advantage. The child born in a
civilized land is not likely, as such, to be superior to
one born among barbarians; and the difference which
ensues between the acts of the two children will be
caused, so far as we know, solely by the pressure of
external circumstances; by which I mean the surrounding
opinions, knowledge, associations; in a word, the
entire mental atmosphere in which the two children
are respectively nurtured.</p>

<p>On this account it is evident, that if we look at mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in the aggregate, their moral and intellectual conduct
is regulated by the moral and intellectual notions
prevalent in their own time. There are, of course, many
persons who will rise above those notions, and many
others who will sink below them. But such cases are
exceptional, and form a very small proportion of the
total amount of those who are nowise remarkable either
for good or for evil. An immense majority of men must
always remain in a middle state, neither very foolish
nor very able, neither very virtuous nor very vicious,
but slumbering on in a peaceful and decent mediocrity,
adopting without much difficulty the current opinions of
the day, making no inquiry, exciting no scandal, causing
no wonder, just holding themselves on a level with their
generation, and noiselessly conforming to the standard
of morals and of knowledge common to the age and
country in which they live.</p>

<p>Now, it requires but a superficial acquaintance with
history to be aware that this standard is constantly
changing, and that it is never precisely the same even
in the most similar countries, or in two successive
generations in the same country. The opinions which
are popular in any nation vary in many respects almost
from year to year; and what in one period is attacked
as a paradox or a heresy, is in another period welcomed
as a sober truth; which, however, in its turn is
replaced by some subsequent novelty. This extreme
mutability in the ordinary standard of human actions
shows that the conditions on which the standard depends
must themselves be very mutable; and those
conditions, whatever they may be, are evidently the
originators of the moral and intellectual conduct of the
great average of mankind.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a basis on which we can safely
proceed. We know that the main cause of human actions
is extremely variable; we have only, therefore, to
apply this test to any set of circumstances which are
supposed to be the cause, and if we find that such circumstances
are not very variable, we must infer that
they are not the cause we are attempting to discover.</p>

<p>Applying this test to moral motives, or to the dictates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of what is called moral instinct, we shall at once
see how extremely small is the influence those motives
have exercised over the progress of civilization. For
there is, unquestionably, nothing to be found in the
world which has undergone so little change as those
great dogmas of which moral systems are composed.
To do good to others; to sacrifice for their benefit your
own wishes; to love your neighbour as yourself; to
forgive your enemies; to restrain your passions; to
honour your parents; to respect those who are set over
you: these, and a few others, are the sole essentials of
morals; but they have been known for thousands of
years, and not one jot or tittle has been added to them
by all the sermons, homilies, and text-books which
moralists and theologians have been able to produce.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>But, if we contrast this stationary aspect of moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
truths with the progressive aspect of intellectual truths,
the difference is indeed startling.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> All the great moral
systems which have exercised much influence have been
fundamentally the same; all the great intellectual systems
have been fundamentally different. In reference
to our moral conduct, there is not a single principle
now known to the most cultivated Europeans, which was
not likewise known to the ancients. In reference to
the conduct of our intellect, the moderns have not only
made the most important additions to every department
of knowledge that the ancients ever attempted to study,
but besides this, they have upset and revolutionized the
old methods of inquiry; they have consolidated into one
great scheme all those resources of induction which
Aristotle alone dimly perceived; and they have created
sciences, the faintest idea of which never entered the
mind of the boldest thinker antiquity produced.</p>

<p>These are, to every educated man, recognized and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
notorious facts; and the inference to be drawn from
them is immediately obvious. Since civilization is the
product of moral and intellectual agencies, and since
that product is constantly changing, it evidently cannot
be regulated by the stationary agent; because, when
surrounding circumstances are unchanged, a stationary
agent can only produce a stationary effect. The only
other agent is the intellectual one; and that this is the
real mover may be proved in two distinct ways: first,
because being, as we have already seen, either moral
or intellectual, and being, as we have also seen, not
moral, it must be intellectual; and, secondly, because
the intellectual principle has an activity and a capacity
for adaptation, which, as I undertake to show, is quite
sufficient to account for the extraordinary progress
that, during several centuries, Europe has continued
to make.</p>

<p>Such are the main arguments by which my view is
supported; but there are also other and collateral
circumstances which are well worthy of consideration.
The first is, that the intellectual principle is not only
far more progressive than the moral principle, but is
also far more permanent in its results. The acquisitions
made by the intellect are, in every civilized country,
carefully preserved, registered in certain well-understood
formulas, and protected by the use of technical
and scientific language; they are easily handed down
from one generation to another, and thus assuming an
accessible, or, as it were, a tangible form, they often
influence the most distant posterity, they become the
heirlooms of mankind, the immortal bequest of the
genius to which they owe their birth. But the good
deeds effected by our moral faculties are less capable of
transmission; they are of a more private and retiring
character; while, as the motives to which they owe
their origin are generally the result of self-discipline
and of self-sacrifice, they have to be worked out by
every man for himself; and thus, begun by each anew,
they derive little benefit from the maxims of preceding
experience, nor can they well be stored up for the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of future moralists. The consequence is, that although
moral excellence is more amiable, and to most persons
more attractive, than intellectual excellence, still, it
must be confessed that, looking at ulterior results, it is
far less active, less permanent, and, as I shall presently
prove, less productive of real good. Indeed, if we
examine the effects of the most active philanthropy, and
of the largest and most disinterested kindness, we shall
find that those effects are, comparatively speaking, short-lived;
that there is only a small number of individuals
they come in contact with and benefit; that they rarely
survive the generation which witnessed their commencement;
and that, when they take the more durable form
of founding great public charities, such institutions
invariably fall, first into abuse, then into decay, and
after a time are either destroyed, or perverted from
their original intention, mocking the effort by which
it is vainly attempted to perpetuate the memory even
of the purest and most energetic benevolence.</p>

<p>These conclusions are no doubt very unpalatable;
and what makes them peculiarly offensive is, that it is
impossible to refute them. For the deeper we penetrate
into this question, the more clearly shall we see
the superiority of intellectual acquisitions over moral
feeling.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> There is no instance on record of an ignorant
man who, having good intentions, and supreme power
to enforce them, has not done far more evil than good.
And whenever the intentions have been very eager,
and the power very extensive, the evil has been enormous.
But if you can diminish the sincerity of that
man, if you can mix some alloy with his motives, you
will likewise diminish the evil which he works. If he
is selfish as well as ignorant, it will often happen that
you may play off his vice against his ignorance, and by
exciting his fears restrain his mischief. If, however,
he has no fear, if he is entirely unselfish, if his sole
object is the good of others, if he pursues that object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
with enthusiasm, upon a large scale, and with disinterested
zeal, then it is that you have no check upon
him, you have no means of preventing the calamities
which, in an ignorant age, an ignorant man will be
sure to inflict. How entirely this is verified by experience,
we may see in studying the history of religious
persecution. To punish even a single man for his
religious tenets, is assuredly a crime of the deepest
dye; but to punish a large body of men, to persecute
an entire sect, to attempt to extirpate opinions, which,
growing out of the state of society in which they arise,
are themselves a manifestation of the marvellous and
luxuriant fertility of the human mind,&mdash;to do this is
not only one of the most pernicious, but one of the
most foolish acts that can possibly be conceived.
Nevertheless, it is an undoubted fact that an overwhelming
majority of religious persecutors have been
men of the purest intentions, of the most admirable
and unsullied morals. It is impossible that this should
be otherwise. For they are not bad-intentioned men,
who seek to enforce opinions which they believe to be
good. Still less are they bad men, who are so regardless
of temporal considerations as to employ all the
resources of their power, not for their own benefit, but
for the purpose of propagating a religion which they
think necessary to the future happiness of mankind.
Such men as these are not bad, they are only ignorant;
ignorant of the nature of truth, ignorant of the consequences
of their own acts. But, in a moral point of
view, their motives are unimpeachable. Indeed, it is
the very ardour of their sincerity which warms them
into persecution. It is the holy zeal by which they
are fired that quickens their fanaticism into a deadly
activity. If you can impress any man with an absorbing
conviction of the supreme importance of some
moral or religious doctrine; if you can make him
believe that those who reject that doctrine are doomed
to eternal perdition; if you then give that man power,
and by means of his ignorance blind him to the ulterior
consequences of his own act,&mdash;he will infallibly persecute
those who deny his doctrine; and the extent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
his persecution will be regulated by the extent of his
sincerity. Diminish the sincerity, and you will diminish
the persecution: in other words, by weakening
the virtue you may check the evil. This is a truth of
which history furnishes such innumerable examples,
that to deny it would be not only to reject the plainest
and most conclusive arguments, but to refuse the concurrent
testimony of every age. I will merely select
two cases, which, from the entire difference in their
circumstances, are very apposite as illustrations: the
first being from the history of Paganism, the other
from the history of Christianity; and both proving the
inability of moral feelings to control religious persecution.</p>

<p>I. The Roman emperors, as is well known, subjected
the early Christians to persecutions, which, though
they have been exaggerated, were frequent and very
grievous. But what to some persons must appear
extremely strange, is, that among the active authors of
these cruelties, we find the names of the best men who
ever sat on the throne; while the worst and most infamous
princes were precisely those who spared the
Christians, and took no heed of their increase. The
two most thoroughly depraved of all the emperors were
certainly Commodus and Elagabalus; neither of whom
persecuted the new religion, or indeed adopted any
measures against it. They were too reckless of the
future, too selfish, too absorbed in their own infamous
pleasures, to mind whether truth or error prevailed;
and being thus indifferent to the welfare of their subjects,
they cared nothing about the progress of a creed,
which they, as Pagan emperors, were bound to regard
as a fatal and impious delusion. They, therefore,
allowed Christianity to run its course, unchecked by
those penal laws which more honest, but more mistaken,
rulers would assuredly have enacted.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> We find,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
accordingly, that the great enemy of Christianity was
Marcus Aurelius: a man of kindly temper, and of fearless,
unflinching honesty, but whose reign was characterized
by a persecution from which he would have
refrained had he been less in earnest about the religion
of his fathers.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> And to complete the argument, it
may be added, that the last and one of the most
strenuous of the opponents of Christianity, who occupied
the throne of the Cæsars, was Julian: a prince
of eminent probity, whose opinions are often attacked,
but against whose moral conduct even calumny itself
has hardly breathed a suspicion.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>II. The second illustration is supplied by Spain; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
country of which it must be confessed, that in no other
have religious feelings exercised such sway over the
affairs of men. No other European nation has produced
so many ardent and disinterested missionaries,
zealous self-denying martyrs, who have cheerfully
sacrificed their lives in order to propagate truths
which they thought necessary to be known. Nowhere
else have the spiritual classes been so long in the
ascendant; nowhere else are the people so devout, the
churches so crowded, the clergy so numerous. But
the sincerity and the honesty of purpose by which the
Spanish people, taken as a whole, have always been
marked, have not only been unable to prevent religious
persecution, but have proved the means of encouraging
it. If the nation had been more lukewarm, it would
have been more tolerant. As it was, the preservation
of the faith became the first consideration; and everything
being sacrificed to this one object, it naturally
happened that zeal begat cruelty, and the soil was prepared
in which the Inquisition took root and flourished.
The supporters of that barbarous institution were not
hypocrites, but enthusiasts. Hypocrites are for the
most part too supple to be cruel. For cruelty is a stern
and unbending passion; while hypocrisy is a fawning
and flexible art, which accommodates itself to human
feelings, and flatters the weakness of men in order that
it may gain its own ends. In Spain, the earnestness
of the nation, being concentrated on a single topic,
carried everything before it; and hatred of heresy becoming
a habit, persecution of heresy was thought a duty.
The conscientious energy with which that duty was fulfilled
is seen in the history of the Spanish Church.
Indeed, that the inquisitors were remarkable for an
undeviating and incorruptible integrity, may be proved
in a variety of ways, and from different and independent
sources of evidence. This is a question to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
I shall hereafter return; but there are two testimonies
which I cannot omit, because, from the circumstances
attending them, they are peculiarly unimpeachable.
Llorente, the great historian of the Inquisition, and its
bitter enemy, had access to its private papers; and yet,
with the fullest means of information, he does not even
insinuate a charge against the moral character of the
inquisitors; but while execrating the cruelty of their
conduct, he cannot deny the purity of their intentions.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
Thirty years earlier, Townsend, a clergyman of
the Church of England, published his valuable work
on Spain;<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> and though, as a Protestant and an Englishman,
he had every reason to be prejudiced against the
infamous system which he describes, he also can bring
no charge against those who upheld it; but having
occasion to mention its establishment at Barcelona,
one of its most important branches, he makes the
remarkable admission, that all its members are men of
worth, and that most of them are of distinguished
humanity.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>These facts, startling as they are, form a very small
part of that vast mass of evidence which history contains,
and which decisively proves the utter inability of
moral feelings to diminish religious persecution. The
way in which the diminution has been really effected
by the mere progress of intellectual acquirements, will
be pointed out in another part of this volume; when
we shall see that the great antagonist of intolerance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
not humanity, but knowledge. It is to the diffusion of
knowledge, and to that alone, that we owe the comparative
cessation of what is unquestionably the greatest
evil men have ever inflicted on their own species. For
that religious persecution is a greater evil than any
other, is apparent, not so much from the enormous and
almost incredible number of its known victims,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> as from
the fact that the unknown must be far more numerous,
and that history gives no account of those who have
been spared in the body, in order that they might
suffer in the mind. We hear much of martyrs and confessors&mdash;of
those who were slain by the sword, or
consumed in the fire; but we know little of that still
larger number who, by the mere threat of persecution,
have been driven into an outward abandonment of
their real opinions; and who, thus forced into an
apostasy the heart abhors, have passed the remainder of
their life in the practice of a constant and humiliating
hypocrisy. It is this which is the real curse of religious
persecution. For in this way, men being constrained
to mask their thoughts, there arises a habit of securing
safety by falsehood, and of purchasing impunity with
deceit. In this way fraud becomes a necessary of life;
insincerity is made a daily custom; the whole tone of
public feeling is vitiated, and the gross amount of vice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and of error fearfully increased. Surely, then, we have
reason to say, that, compared to this, all other crimes
are of small account; and we may well be grateful for
that increase of intellectual pursuits which has destroyed
an evil that some among us would even now
willingly restore.</p>

<p>The principle I am advocating is of such immense
importance in practice as well as in theory, that I will
give yet another instance of the energy with which it
works. The second greatest evil known to mankind&mdash;the
one by which, with the exception of religious persecution,
most suffering has been caused&mdash;is, unquestionably,
the practice of war. That this barbarous pursuit
is, in the progress of society, steadily declining, must
be evident, even to the most hasty reader of European
history.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> If we compare one country with another, we
shall find that for a very long period wars have been
becoming less frequent; and now so clearly is the movement
marked, that, until the late commencement of hostilities,
we had remained at peace for nearly forty years:
a circumstance unparalleled, not only in our own country,
but also in the annals of every other country which has
been important enough to play a leading part in the
affairs of the world.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> The question arises, as to what
share our moral feelings have had in bringing about this
great improvement. And if this question is answered,
not according to preconceived opinions, but according
to the evidence we possess, the answer will certainly
be, that those feelings have had no share at all. For it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
surely will not be pretended that the moderns have
made any discoveries respecting the moral evils of war.
On this head nothing is now known that has not
been known for many centuries. That defensive wars
are just, and that offensive wars are unjust, are the
only two principles which, on this subject, moralists
are able to teach. These two principles were as clearly
laid down, as well understood, and as universally admitted,
in the Middle Ages, when there was never a
week without war, as they are at the present moment,
when war is deemed a rare and singular occurrence.
Since, then, the actions of men respecting war have
been gradually changing, while their moral knowledge
respecting it has not been changing, it is palpably evident
that the changeable effect has not been produced
by the unchangeable cause. It is impossible to conceive
an argument more decisive than this. If it can
be proved that, during the last thousand years, moralists
or theologians have pointed out a single evil caused by
war, the existence of which was unknown to their predecessors,&mdash;if
this can be proved, I will abandon the
view for which I am contending. But if, as I most
confidently assert, this cannot be proved, then it must
be conceded that, no additions having been made on
this subject to the stock of morals, no additions can
have been made to the result which the morals produce.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Thus far as to the influence exercised by moral feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in increasing our distaste for war. But if, on the
other hand, we turn to the human intellect, in the narrowest
sense of the term, we shall find that every great
increase in its activity has been a heavy blow to the warlike
spirit. The full evidence for this I shall hereafter
detail at considerable length; and in this Introduction I
can only pretend to bring forward a few of those prominent
points, which, being on the surface of history, will
be at once understood.</p>

<p>Of these points, one of the most obvious is, that every
important addition made to knowledge increases the
authority of the intellectual classes, by increasing the
resources which they have to wield. Now, the antagonism
between these classes and the military class is
evident: it is the antagonism between thought and
action, between the internal and the external, between
argument and violence, between persuasion and force;
or, to sum up the whole, between men who live by the
pursuits of peace and those who live by the practice of
war. Whatever, therefore, is favourable to one class, is
manifestly unfavourable to the other. Supposing the
remaining circumstances to be the same, it must happen,
that as the intellectual acquisitions of a people
increase, their love of war will diminish; and if their
intellectual acquisitions are very small, their love of war
will be very great.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In perfectly barbarous countries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
there are no intellectual acquisitions; and the mind
being a blank and dreary waste, the only resource is
external activity,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> the only merit personal courage.
No account is made of any man, unless he has killed
an enemy; and the more he has killed, the greater the
reputation he enjoys.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> This is the purely savage state;
and it is the state in which military glory is most
esteemed, and military men most respected.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
this frightful debasement, even up to the summit of
civilization, there is a long series of consecutive steps;
gradations, at each of which something is taken from
the dominion of force, and something given to the
authority of thought. Slowly, and one by one, the intellectual
and pacific classes begin to arise; at first
held in great contempt by warriors, but nevertheless
gradually gaining ground, increasing in number and in
power, and at each increase weakening that old military
spirit, in which all other tendencies had formerly
been absorbed. Trade, commerce, manufactures, law,
diplomacy, literature, science, philosophy,&mdash;all these
things, originally unknown, became organized into separate
studies, each study having a separate class, and
each class insisting on the importance of its own pursuit.
Of these classes, some are, no doubt, less pacific
than others; but even those which are the least pacific,
are, of course, more so than men whose associations are
entirely military, and who see in every fresh war that
chance of personal distinction, from which, during
peace, they are altogether debarred.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>Thus it is that, as civilization advances, an equipoise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
is established, and military ardour is balanced by motives
which none but a cultivated people can feel. But
among a people whose intellect is not cultivated, such a
balance can never exist. Of this we see a good illustration
in the history of the present war.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> For the peculiarity
of the great contest in which we are engaged is, that it
was produced, not by the conflicting interests of civilized
countries, but by a rupture between Russia and Turkey,
the two most barbarous monarchies now remaining in
Europe. This is a very significant fact. It is highly
characteristic of the actual condition of society, that a
peace of unexampled length should have been broken,
not, as former peaces were broken, by a quarrel between
two civilized nations, but by the encroachments of
the uncivilized Russians on the still more uncivilized
Turks. At an earlier period, the influence of intellectual,
and therefore pacific, habits was indeed constantly increasing,
but was still too weak, even in the most
advanced countries, to control the old warlike habits:
hence there arose a desire for conquest, which often
outweighed all other feelings, and induced great nations
like France and England to attack each other on the
slightest pretence, and seek every opportunity of gratifying
the vindictive hatred with which both contemplated
the prosperity of their neighbour. Such, however, is
now the progress of affairs, that these two nations, laying
aside the peevish and irritable jealousy they once entertained,
are united in a common cause, and have drawn
the sword, not for selfish purposes, but to protect the
civilized world against the incursions of a barbarous foe.</p>

<p>This is the leading feature which distinguishes the
present war from its predecessors. That a peace should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
last for nearly forty years, and should then be interrupted,
not, as heretofore, by hostilities between civilized states,
but by the ambition of the only empire which is at once
powerful and uncivilized&mdash;is one of many proofs that a
dislike to war is a cultivated taste peculiar to an intellectual
people. For no one will pretend that the military
predilections of Russia are caused by a low state of
morals, or by a disregard of religious duties. So far
from this, all the evidence we have shows that vicious
habits are not more common in Russia than in France
or England;<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> and it is certain that the Russians submit
to the teachings of the church with a docility greater
than that displayed by their civilized opponents.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> It
is, therefore, clear that Russia is a warlike country, not
because the inhabitants are immoral, but because they
are unintellectual. The fault is in the head, not in the
heart. In Russia, the national intellect being little cultivated,
the intellectual classes lack influence; the military
class, therefore, is supreme. In this early stage of
society, there is as yet no middle rank,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and consequently
the thoughtful and pacific habits which spring from the
middle ranks have no existence. The minds of men,
deprived of mental pursuits,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> naturally turn to warlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
ones, as the only resource remaining to them. Hence it
is that, in Russia, all ability is estimated by a military
standard. The army is considered to be the greatest
glory of the country: to win a battle, or outwit an enemy,
is valued as one of the noblest achievements of life; and
civilians, whatever their merits may be, are despised by
this barbarous people, as beings of an altogether inferior
and subordinate character.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>In England, on the other hand, opposite causes have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
produced opposite results. With us intellectual progress
is so rapid, and the authority of the middle class so great,
that not only have military men no influence in the government
of the state, but there seemed at one time even
a danger lest we should push this feeling to an extreme;
and lest, from our detestation of war, we should neglect
those defensive precautions which the enmity of other
nations makes it advisable to adopt. But this at least
we may safely say, that, in our country, a love of war
is, as a national taste, utterly extinct. And this vast
result has been effected, not by moral teachings, nor by
the dictates of moral instinct; but by the simple fact,
that in the progress of civilization there have been formed
certain classes of society which have an interest in the
preservation of peace, and whose united authority is
sufficient to control those other classes whose interest
lies in the prosecution of war.</p>

<p>It would be easy to conduct this argument further,
and to prove how, by an increasing love of intellectual
pursuits, the military service necessarily declines, not
only in reputation, but likewise in ability. In a backward
state of society men of distinguished talents crowd to
the army, and are proud to enrol themselves in its
ranks. But, as society advances, new sources of activity
are opened, and new professions arise, which, being essentially
mental, offer to genius opportunities for success
more rapid than any formerly known. The consequence
is, that in England, where these opportunities are more
numerous than elsewhere, it nearly always happens that
if a father has a son whose faculties are remarkable, he
brings him up to one of the lay professions, where intellect,
when accompanied by industry, is sure to be rewarded.
If, however, the inferiority of the boy is obvious, a suitable
remedy is at hand: he is made either a soldier or
a clergyman; he is sent into the army, or hidden in the
church. And this, as we shall hereafter see, is one of
the reasons why, as society advances, the ecclesiastical
spirit and the military spirit never fail to decline. As
soon as eminent men grow unwilling to enter any profession,
the lustre of that profession will be tarnished:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
first its reputation will be lessened, and then its power
will be abridged. This is the process through which
Europe is actually passing, in regard both to the church
and to the army. The evidence, so far as the ecclesiastical
profession is concerned, will be found in another
part of this work. The evidence respecting the military
profession is equally decisive. For although that profession
has in modern Europe produced a few men of undoubted
genius, their number is so extremely small, as
to amaze us at the dearth of original ability. That the
military class, taken as a whole, has a tendency to degenerate,
will become still more obvious if we compare
long periods of time. In the ancient world, the leading
warriors were not only possessed of considerable accomplishments,
but were comprehensive thinkers in politics
as well as in war, and were in every respect the first
characters of their age. Thus&mdash;to give only a few specimens
from a single people&mdash;we find that the three most
successful statesmen Greece ever produced were Solon,
Themistocles, and Epaminondas,&mdash;all of whom were distinguished
military commanders. Socrates, supposed by
some to be the wisest of the ancients, was a soldier; and
so was Plato; and so was Antisthenes, the celebrated
founder of the Cynics. Archytas, who gave a new direction
to the Pythagorean philosophy; and Melissus, who
developed the Eleatic philosophy&mdash;were both of them
well-known generals, famous alike in literature and in
war. Among the most eminent orators, Pericles, Alcibiades,
Andocides, Demosthenes, and Æschines were all
members of the military profession; as also were the
two greatest tragic writers, Æschylus and Sophocles.
Archilochus, who is said to have invented iambic verses,
and whom Horace took as a model, was a soldier; and
the same profession could likewise boast of Tyrtæus, one
of the founders of elegiac poetry, and of Alcæus, one of
the best composers of lyric poetry. The most philosophic
of all the Greek historians was certainly Thucydides;
but he, as well as Xenophon and Polybius, held high
military appointments, and on more than one occasion
succeeded in changing the fortunes of war. In the midst
of the hurry and turmoil of camps, these eminent men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
cultivated their minds to the highest point that the knowledge
of that age would allow: and so wide is the range
of their thoughts, and such the beauty and dignity of
their style, that their works are read by thousands who
care nothing about the sieges and battles in which they
were engaged.</p>

<p>These were among the ornaments of the military profession
in the ancient world; and all of them wrote in
the same language, and were read by the same people.
But in the modern world this identical profession, including
many millions of men, and covering the whole of
Europe, has never been able, since the sixteenth century,
to produce ten authors who have reached the first class
either as writers or as thinkers. Descartes is an instance
of an European soldier combining the two qualities; he
being as remarkable for the exquisite beauty of his style
as for the depth and originality of his inquiries. This,
however, is a solitary case; and there is, I believe, no
second one of a modern military writer thus excelling in
both departments. Certainly, the English army, during
the last two hundred and fifty years, affords no example
of it, and has, in fact, only possessed two authors,
Raleigh and Napier, whose works are recognized as
models, and are studied merely for their intrinsic merit.
Still, this is simply in reference to style; and these two
historians, notwithstanding their skill in composition,
have never been reputed profound thinkers on difficult
subjects, nor have they added anything of moment to
the stock of our knowledge. In the same way, among
the ancients, the most eminent soldiers were likewise
the most eminent politicians, and the best leaders of the
army were generally the best governors of the state.
But here, again, the progress of society has wrought so
great a change, that for a long period instances of this
have been excessively rare. Even Gustavus Adolphus
and Frederick the Great failed ignominiously in their
domestic policy, and showed themselves as short-sighted
in the arts of peace as they were sagacious in the arts
of war. Cromwell, Washington, and Napoleon are, perhaps,
the only first-rate modern warriors of whom it can
be fairly said, that they were equally competent to govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
a kingdom and command an army. And, if we look at
England as furnishing a familiar illustration, we see this
remark exemplified in our two greatest generals, Marlborough
and Wellington. Marlborough was a man not
only of the most idle and frivolous pursuits, but was so
miserably ignorant, that his deficiencies made him the
ridicule of his contemporaries; and of politics he had no
other idea but to gain the favour of the sovereign by
flattering his mistress, to desert the brother of that sovereign
at his utmost need, and afterwards, by a double
treachery, turn against his next benefactor, and engage
in a criminal, as well as a foolish, correspondence with
the very man whom a few years before he had infamously
abandoned. These were the characteristics of the greatest
conqueror of his age, the hero of a hundred fights,
the victor of Blenheim and of Ramilies. As to our other
great warrior, it is indeed true that the name of Wellington
should never be pronounced by an Englishman without
gratitude and respect: these feelings are, however,
due solely to his vast military services, the importance
of which it would ill become us to forget. But whoever
has studied the civil history of England during the present
century knows full well that this military chief,
who in the field shone without a rival, and who, to his
still greater glory be it said, possessed an integrity of purpose,
an unflinching honesty, and a high moral feeling,
which could not be surpassed, was nevertheless utterly
unequal to the complicated exigencies of political life. It
is notorious, that in his views of the most important legislative
measures he was always in the wrong. It is notorious,
and the evidence of it stands recorded in our Parliamentary
Debates, that every great measure which was
carried, every great improvement, every great step in
reform, every concession to the popular wishes, was
strenuously opposed by the Duke of Wellington, became
law in spite of his opposition, and after his mournful
declarations that by such means the security of England
would be seriously imperilled. Yet there is now hardly a
forward schoolboy who does not know that to these very
measures the present stability of our country is mainly
owing. Experience, the great test of wisdom, has amply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
proved, that those vast schemes of reform, which the
Duke of Wellington spent his political life in opposing,
were, I will not say expedient or advisable, but were
indispensably necessary. That policy of resisting the
popular will which he constantly advised is precisely the
policy which has been pursued, since the Congress of
Vienna, in every monarchy except our own. The result
of that policy is written for our instruction: it is written
in that great explosion of popular passion, which in the
moment of its wrath upset the proudest thrones, destroyed
princely families, ruined noble houses, desolated beautiful
cities. And if the counsel of our great general had been
followed, if the just demands of the people had been refused&mdash;this
same lesson would have been written in the
annals of our own land; and we should most assuredly
have been unable to escape the consequence of that terrible
catastrophe, in which the ignorance and selfishness
of rulers did, only a few years ago, involve a large part
of the civilized world.</p>

<p>Thus striking is the contrast between the military
genius of ancient times, and the military genius of modern
Europe. The causes of this decay are clearly traceable
to the circumstance that, owing to the immense increase
of intellectual employments, few men of ability will now
enter a profession into which, in antiquity, men of ability
eagerly crowded, as supplying the best means of exercising
those faculties which, in more civilized countries,
are turned to a better account. This, indeed, is a very
important change; and thus to transfer the most powerful
intellects from the arts of war to the arts of peace,
has been the slow work of many centuries, the gradual,
but constant, encroachments of advancing knowledge.
To write the history of those encroachments would be
to write the history of the human intellect&mdash;a task impossible
for any single man adequately to perform. But
the subject is one of such interest, and has been so little
studied, that though I have already carried this analysis
farther than I had intended, I cannot refrain from noticing
what appear to me to be the three leading ways in
which the warlike spirit of the ancient world has been
weakened by the progress of European knowledge.</p>

<p>The first of these arose out of the invention of Gunpowder;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
which, though a warlike contrivance, has in
its results been eminently serviceable to the interests
of peace.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> This important invention is said to have
been made in the thirteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> but was not in
common use until the fourteenth, or even the beginning
of the fifteenth, century. Scarcely had it come
into operation, when it worked a great change in the
whole scheme and practice of war. Before this time,
it was considered the duty of nearly every citizen to be
prepared to enter the military service, for the purpose
either of defending his own country, or of attacking
others.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Standing armies were entirely unknown;
and in their place there existed a rude and barbarous
militia, always ready for battle, and always unwilling
to engage in those peaceful pursuits which were then
universally despised. Nearly every man being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
soldier, the military profession, as such, had no
separate existence; or, to speak more properly, the
whole of Europe composed one great army, in which
all other professions were merged. To this the only
exception was the ecclesiastical profession; but even
that was affected by the general tendency, and it was
not at all uncommon to see large bodies of troops led
to the field by bishops and abbots, to most of whom
the arts of war were in those days perfectly familiar.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
At all events, between these two professions men were
necessarily divided: the only avocations were war and
theology; and if you refused to enter the church, you
were bound to serve in the army. As a natural consequence,
everything of real importance was altogether
neglected. There were, indeed, many priests and many
warriors, many sermons and many battles.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> But, on
the other hand, there was neither trade, nor commerce,
nor manufactures; there was no science, no literature:
the useful arts were entirely unknown; and even the
highest ranks of society were unacquainted, not only with
the most ordinary comforts, but with the commonest
decencies of civilized life.</p>

<p>But so soon as gunpowder came into use, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
laid the foundation of a great change. According to
the old system, a man had only to possess, what he
generally inherited from his father, either a sword or
a bow, and he was ready equipped for the field.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> According
to the new system, new means were required,
and the equipment became more costly and more
difficult. First, there was the supply of gunpowder;<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
then there was the possession of muskets, which were
expensive weapons, and considered difficult to manage.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
Then, too, there were other contrivances to which gunpowder
naturally gave rise, such as pistols, bombs,
mortars, shells, mines, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> All these things,
by increasing the complication of the military art, increased
the necessity of discipline and practice; while,
at the same time, the change that was being effected
in the ordinary weapons deprived the great majority of
men of the possibility of procuring them. To suit these
altered circumstances, a new system was organized:
and it was found advisable to train up bodies of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
for the sole purpose of war, and to separate them as
much as possible from those other employments in
which formerly all soldiers were occasionally engaged.
Thus it was that there arose standing armies; the first
of which were formed in the middle of the fifteenth
century,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> almost immediately after gunpowder was
generally known. Thus, too, there arose the custom of
employing mercenary troops; of which we find a few
earlier instances, though the practice was not fully
established until the latter part of the fourteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>The importance of this movement was soon seen, by
the change it effected in the classification of European
society. The regular troops being, from their discipline,
more serviceable against the enemy, and also more immediately
under the control of the government, it naturally
followed that, as their merits became understood,
the old militia should fall, first into disrepute, then be
neglected, and then sensibly diminish. At the same
time, this diminution in the number of undisciplined
soldiers deprived the country of a part of its warlike
resources, and therefore made it necessary to pay more
attention to the disciplined ones, and to confine them
more exclusively to their military duties. Thus it was
that a division was first broadly established between the
soldier and the civilian; and there arose a separate military
profession,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> which, consisting of a comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
small number of the total amount of citizens, left the
remainder to settle in some other pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> In this way
immense bodies of men were gradually weaned from
their old warlike habits; and being, as it were, forced
into civil life, their energies became available for the
general purposes of society, and for the cultivation of
those arts of peace which had formerly been neglected.
The result was, that the European mind, instead of
being, as heretofore, solely occupied either with war or
with theology, now struck out into a middle path, and
created those great branches of knowledge to which
modern civilization owes its origin. In each successive
generation this tendency towards a separate organization
was more marked; the utility of a division of
labour became clearly recognized; and by this means
knowledge itself advanced, the authority of this middle
or intellectual class correspondingly increased. Each
addition to its power lessened the weight of the other
two classes, and checked those superstitious feelings
and that love of war, on which, in an early state of
society, all enthusiasm is concentrated. The evidence
of the growth and diffusion of this intellectual principle
is so full and decisive, that it would be possible, by
combining all the branches of knowledge, to trace
nearly the whole of its consecutive steps. At present,
it is enough to say, that, taking a general view, this
third, or intellectual, class, first displayed an independent,
though still a vague, activity in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries; that in the sixteenth century,
this activity, assuming a distinct form, showed itself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
religious outbreaks; that in the seventeenth century,
its energy, becoming more practical, was turned against
the abuses of government, and caused a series of
rebellions, from which hardly any part of Europe
escaped; and finally, that in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, it has extended its aim to every
department of public and private life, diffusing education,
teaching legislators, controlling kings, and, above
all, settling on a sure foundation that supremacy of
Public Opinion, to which not only constitutional
princes, but even the most despotic sovereigns, are
now rendered strictly amenable.</p>

<p>These, indeed, are vast questions; and, without some
knowledge of them, no one can understand the present
condition of European society, or form the least idea of
its future prospects. It is, however, sufficient that the
reader can now perceive the way in which so slight a
matter as the invention of gunpowder diminished the
warlike spirit, by diminishing the number of persons to
whom the practice of war was habitual. There were, no
doubt, other and collateral circumstances which tended
in the same direction; but the use of gunpowder was the
most effectual, because, by increasing the difficulty and
expense of war, it made a separate military profession
indispensable; and thus, curtailing the action of the
military spirit, left an overplus, an unemployed energy,
which soon found its way to the pursuits of peace,
infused into them a new life, and began to control that
lust of conquest, which, though natural to a barbarous
people, is the great enemy of knowledge, and is the
most fatal of those diseased appetites by which even
civilized countries are too often afflicted.</p>

<p>The second intellectual movement, by which the love
of war has been lessened, is much more recent, and has
not yet produced the whole of its natural effects. I
allude to the discoveries made by Political Economy:
a branch of knowledge with which even the wisest of
the ancients had not the least acquaintance, but which
possesses an importance it would be difficult to exaggerate,
and is, moreover, remarkable, as being the
only subject immediately connected with the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
government that has yet been raised to a science. The
practical value of this noble study, though perhaps only
fully known to the more advanced thinkers, is gradually
becoming recognized by men of ordinary education:
but even those by whom it is understood seem
to have paid little attention to the way in which, by
its influence, the interests of peace, and therefore of
civilization, have been directly promoted.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The manner
in which this has been brought about, I will endeavour
to explain, as it will furnish another argument
in support of that great principle which I wish to
establish.</p>

<p>It is well known, that, among the different causes of
war, commercial jealousy was formerly one of the most
conspicuous; and there are numerous instances of quarrels
respecting the promulgation of some particular
tariff, or the protection of some favourite manufacture.
Disputes of this kind were founded upon the very
ignorant, but the very natural notion, that the advantages
of commerce depend upon the balance of trade,
and that whatever is gained by one country must be
lost by another. It was believed that wealth is composed
entirely of money; and that it is, therefore, the
essential interest of every people to import few commodities
and much gold. Whenever this was done,
affairs were said to be in a sound and healthy state;
but, if this was not done, it was declared that we were
being drained of our resources, and that some other
country was getting the better of us, and was enriching
itself at our expense.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> For this the only remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was to negotiate a commercial treaty, which should
oblige the offending nation to take more of our commodities,
and give us more of their gold: if, however,
they refused to sign the treaty, it became necessary to
bring them to reason; and for this purpose an armament
was fitted out to attack a people who, by lessening
our wealth, had deprived us of that money by which
alone trade could be extended in foreign markets.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>This misconception of the true nature of barter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
formerly universal;<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> and being adopted even by the
ablest politicians, was not only an immediate cause of
war, but increased those feelings of natural hatred by
which war is encouraged; each country thinking that
it had a direct interest in diminishing the wealth of its
neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> In the seventeenth, or even late in the
sixteenth century, there were, indeed, one or two eminent
thinkers who exposed some of the fallacies upon which
this opinion was based.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> But their arguments found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
no favour with those politicians by whom European
affairs were then administered. It is doubtful if they
were known; and it is certain that, if known, they
were despised by statesmen and legislators, who, from
the constancy of their practical occupations, cannot be
supposed to have sufficient leisure to master each new
discovery that is successively made; and who in consequence
are, as a body, always in the rear of their
age. The result was, that they went blundering on in
the old track, believing that no commerce could flourish
without their interference, troubling that commerce by
repeated and harassing regulations, and taking for
granted that it was the duty of every government to
benefit the trade of their own people by injuring the
trade of others.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>But in the eighteenth century, a long course of
events, which I shall hereafter trace, prepared the way
for a spirit of improvement, and a desire for reform, of
which the world had then seen no example. This great
movement displayed its energy in every department of
knowledge; and now it was that a successful attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was first made to raise Political Economy to a science,
by discovering the laws which regulate the creation
and diffusion of wealth. In the year 1776, Adam
Smith published his <i>Wealth of Nations</i>; which, looking
at its ultimate results, is probably the most important
book that has ever been written, and is certainly the
most valuable contribution ever made by a single man
towards establishing the principles on which government
should be based. In this great work, the old
theory of protection as applied to commerce was destroyed
in nearly all its parts;<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> the doctrine of the
balance of trade was not only attacked, but its falsehood
was demonstrated; and innumerable absurdities,
which had been accumulating for ages, were suddenly
swept away.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>If the <i>Wealth of Nations</i> had appeared in any preceding
century, it would have shared the fate of the
great works of Stafford and Serra; and although the
principles which it advocated would, no doubt, have
excited the attention of speculative thinkers, they
would, in all probability, have produced no effect on
practical politicians, or, at all events, would only have
exercised an indirect and precarious influence. But
the diffusion of knowledge had now become so general,
that even our ordinary legislators were, in some degree,
prepared for these great truths, which, in a
former period, they would have despised as idle
novelties. The result was, that the doctrines of Adam
Smith soon found their way into the House of Commons;<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
and, being adopted by a few of the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
members, were listened to with astonishment by that
great assembly, whose opinions were mainly regulated
by the wisdom of their ancestors, and who were loth to
believe that anything could be discovered by the moderns
which was not already known to the ancients. But it
is in vain that such men as these always set themselves
up to resist the pressure of advancing knowledge. No
great truth which has once been found has ever afterwards
been lost; nor has any important discovery yet
been made which has not eventually carried everything
before it. Even so, the principles of Free Trade, as
demonstrated by Adam Smith, and all the consequences
which flow from them, were vainly struggled against by
the most overwhelming majorities of both Houses of
Parliament. Year by year the great truth made its
way; always advancing, never receding.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> The
majority was at first deserted by a few men of
ability, then by ordinary men, then it became a
minority, then even the minority began to dwindle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and at the present day, eighty years after the publication
of Smith's <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, there is not to be
found any one of tolerable education who is not ashamed
of holding opinions which, before the time of Adam
Smith, were universally received.</p>

<p>Such is the way in which great thinkers control the
affairs of men, and by their discoveries regulate the
march of nations. And truly the history of this one
triumph alone should be enough to repress the presumption
of statesmen and legislators, who so exaggerate
the importance of their craft as to ascribe great
results to their own shifting and temporary contrivances.
For, whence did they derive that knowledge,
of which they are always ready to assume the merit?
How did they obtain their opinions? How did they
get at their principles? These are the elements of
their success; and these they can only learn from their
masters&mdash;from those great teachers, who, moved by the
inspiration of genius, fertilize the world with their discoveries.
Well may it be said of Adam Smith, and
said, too, without fear of contradiction, that this solitary
Scotchman has, by the publication of one single work,
contributed more towards the happiness of man, than
has been effected by the united abilities of all the
statesmen and legislators of whom history has preserved
an authentic account.</p>

<p>The result of these great discoveries I am not here
concerned to examine, except so far as they aided in
diminishing the energy of the warlike spirit. And the way
in which they effected this may be easily stated. As long
as it was generally believed that the wealth of a country
consists of its gold, it was of course also believed that
the sole object of trade is to increase the influx of the
precious metals; it, therefore, became natural that
Government should be expected to take measures by
which such influx could be secured. This, however,
could only be done by draining other countries of their
gold; a result which they, for precisely the same
reasons, strenuously resisted. The consequence was,
that any idea of real reciprocity was impossible: every
commercial treaty was an attempt made by one nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to outwit another;<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> every new tariff was a declaration
of hostility; and that which ought to be the most
peaceable of all pursuits became one of the causes of
those national jealousies and national animosities, by
which war is mainly promoted.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> But when it was
once clearly understood that gold and silver are not
wealth, but are merely the representatives of wealth;
when men began to see that wealth itself solely consists
of the value which skill and labour can add to the raw
material, and that money is of no possible use to a nation
except to measure and circulate their riches; when these
great truths were recognized,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> all the old notions respecting
the balance of trade, and the supreme importance
of the precious metals, at once fell to the ground. These
enormous errors being dispersed, the true theory of
barter was easily worked out. It was perceived, that
if commerce is allowed to be free, its advantages will
be shared by every country which engages in it; that,
in the absence of monopoly, the benefits of trade are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
necessity reciprocal; and that, so far from depending
on the amount of gold received, they simply arise from
the facility with which a nation gets rid of those commodities
which it can produce most cheaply, and receives
in return those commodities which it could only
produce at a great expense, but which the other nation
can, from the skill of its workmen, or from the bounty
of nature, afford to supply at a lower rate. From this
it followed, that, in a mercantile point of view, it would
be as absurd to attempt to impoverish a people with
whom we trade, as it would be in a tradesman to wish
for the insolvency of a rich and frequent customer.
The result is, that the commercial spirit, which formerly
was often warlike, is now invariably pacific.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
And although it is perfectly true that not one merchant
out of a hundred is familiar with the arguments on
which these economical discoveries are founded, that
does not prevent the effect which the discoveries themselves
produce on his own mind. The mercantile class is,
like every other, acted upon by causes which only a few
members of that class are able to perceive. Thus, for
instance, of all the innumerable opponents of protection,
there are very few indeed who can give valid reasons
to justify their opposition. But this does not prevent
the opposition from taking place. For an immense
majority of men always follow with implicit submission
the spirit of their own time; and the spirit of the
time is merely its knowledge, and the direction that
knowledge takes. As, in the ordinary avocations of
daily life, everyone is benefited, in the increase of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
comforts, and of his general security, by the progress
of many arts and sciences, of which perhaps he does
not even know the name, just so is the mercantile class
benefited by those great economical discoveries which,
in the course of two generations, have already effected
a complete change in the commercial legislation of this
country, and which are now operating slowly, but
steadily, upon those other European states where,
public opinion being less powerful, it is more difficult
to establish great truths and extirpate old abuses.
While, therefore, it is perfectly true, that among
merchants, a comparatively small number are acquainted
with political economy, it is not the less true
that they owe a large part of their wealth to the
political economists; who, by removing the obstacles
with which the ignorance of successive governments
had impeded trade, have now settled on a solid foundation
that commercial prosperity which is by no means
the least of our national glories. Most assuredly is it
also true, that this same intellectual movement has
lessened the chance of war, by ascertaining the principles
which ought to regulate our commercial relations
with foreign countries; by proving, not only the inutility,
but the positive mischief, caused by interfering
with them; and finally, by exploding those long-established
errors, which, inducing men to believe that
nations are the natural enemies of each other, encouraged
those evil feelings, and fostered those national
jealousies, to the strength of which the military spirit
owed no small share of its former influence.</p>

<p>The third great cause by which the love of war has
been weakened, is the way in which discoveries respecting
the application of Steam to the purposes of
travelling have facilitated the intercourse between different
countries, and thus aided in destroying that
ignorant contempt which one nation is too apt to feel
for another. Thus, for instance, the miserable and
impudent falsehoods which a large class of English
writers formerly directed against the morals and
private character of the French, and, to their shame
be it said, even against the chastity of French women,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
tended not a little to embitter the angry feelings then
existing between the two first countries of Europe;
irritating the English against French vices, irritating
the French against English calumnies. In the same
way, there was a time when every honest Englishman
firmly believed that he could beat ten Frenchmen; a
class of beings whom he held in sovereign contempt, as
a lean and stunted race, who drank claret instead of
brandy, who lived entirely off frogs; miserable infidels,
who heard mass every Sunday, who bowed down before
idols, and who even worshipped the Pope. On the
other hand, the French were taught to despise us, as
rude unlettered barbarians, without either taste or
humanity; surly, ill-conditioned men, living in an
unhappy climate, where a perpetual fog, only varied
by rain, prevented the sun from ever being seen; suffering
from so deep and inveterate a melancholy, that
physicians had called it the English spleen; and under
the influence of this cruel malady constantly committing
suicide, particularly in November, when we were
well known to hang and shoot ourselves by thousands.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>Whoever has looked much into the older literature
of France and England, knows that these were the
opinions which the two first nations of Europe, in the
ignorance and simplicity of their hearts, held respecting
each other. But the progress of improvement, by
bringing the two countries into close and intimate
contact, has dissipated these foolish prejudices, and
taught each people to admire, and, what is still more
important, to respect each other. And the greater the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
contact, the greater the respect. For, whatever theologians
may choose to assert, it is certain that mankind
at large has far more virtue than vice, and that in
every country good actions are more frequent than bad
ones. Indeed, if this were otherwise, the preponderance
of evil would long since have destroyed the human
race, and not even have left a single man to lament the
degeneracy of his species. An additional proof of this
is the fact, that the more nations associate with each
other, and the more they see and know of their fellow-creatures,
the more quickly do ancient enmities disappear.
This is because an enlarged experience proves
that mankind is not so radically bad as we from our
infancy are taught to believe. But if vices were really
more frequent than virtues, the result would be, that
the increasing amalgamation of society would increase
our bad opinion of others; because, though we may
love our own vices, we do not generally love the vices
of our neighbours. So far, however, is this from being
the actual consequence, that it has always been found
that those whose extensive knowledge makes them best
acquainted with the general course of human actions,
are precisely those who take the most favourable view
of them. The greatest observer and the most profound
thinker is invariably the most lenient judge. It is the
solitary misanthrope, brooding over his fancied wrongs,
who is most prone to depreciate the good qualities of
our nature, and exaggerate its bad ones. Or else it is
some foolish and ignorant monk, who, dreaming away
his existence in an idle solitude, flatters his own vanity
by denouncing the vices of others; and thus declaiming
against the enjoyments of life, revenges himself on
that society from which by his own superstition he is
excluded. These are the sort of men who insist most
strongly on the corruption of our nature, and on the
degeneracy into which we have fallen. The enormous
evil which such opinions have brought about, is well
understood by those who have studied the history of
countries in which they are, and have been, most prevalent.
Hence it is that, among the innumerable benefits
derived from advancing knowledge, there are few more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
important than those improved facilities of communication,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
which, by increasing the frequency with which
nations and individuals are brought into contact, have,
to an extraordinary extent, corrected their prejudices,
raised the opinion which each forms of the other,
diminished their mutual hostility, and thus diffusing a
more favourable view of our common nature, have
stimulated us to develop those boundless resources of
the human understanding, the very existence of which
it was once considered almost a heresy to assert.</p>

<p>This is precisely what has occurred in modern
Europe. The French and English people have, by the
mere force of increased contact, learned to think more
favourably of each other, and to discard that foolish
contempt in which both nations formerly indulged.
In this, as in all cases, the better one civilized country
is acquainted with another, the more it will find to
respect and to imitate. For of all the causes of national
hatred, ignorance is the most powerful. When you
increase the contact, you remove the ignorance, and
thus you diminish the hatred.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> This is the true bond
of charity; and it is worth all the lessons which moralists
and divines are able to teach. They have pursued
their vocation for centuries, without producing the least
effect in lessening the frequency of war. But it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
be said without the slightest exaggeration, that every
new railroad which is laid down, and every fresh
steamer which crosses the Channel, are additional
guarantees for the preservation of that long and unbroken
peace which, during forty years, has knit together
the fortunes and the interests of the two most
civilized nations of the earth.</p>

<p>I have thus, so far as my knowledge will permit, endeavoured
to indicate the causes which have diminished
religious persecution and war: the two greatest evils
with which men have yet contrived to afflict their
fellow-creatures. The question of the decline of religious
persecution I have only briefly noticed, because
it will be more fully handled in a subsequent part of
this volume. Enough, however, has been advanced to
prove how essentially it is an intellectual process, and
how little good can be effected on this subject by the
operation of moral feelings. The causes of the decline
of the warlike spirit I have examined at considerable,
and, perhaps, to some readers, at tedious length, and
the result of that examination has been, that the decline
is owing to the increase of the intellectual classes,
to whom the military classes are necessarily antagonistic.
In pushing the inquiry a little deeper, we
have, by still further analysis, ascertained the existence
of three vast though subsidiary causes, by which the
general movement has been accelerated. These are&mdash;the
invention of Gunpowder, the discoveries of Political
Economy, and the discovery of improved means of
Locomotion. Such are the three great modes or channels
by which the progress of knowledge has weakened
the old warlike spirit; and the way in which they have
effected this has, I trust, been clearly pointed out.
The facts and arguments which I have brought forward,
have, I can conscientiously say, been subjected to careful
and repeated scrutiny; and I am quite unable to
see on what possible ground their accuracy is to be
impugned. That they will be disagreeable to certain
classes, I am well aware; but the unpleasantness of a
statement is hardly to be considered a proof of its
falsehood. The sources from which the evidence has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
been derived are fully indicated; and the arguments, I
hope, fairly stated. And from them there results a most
important conclusion. From them we are bound to
infer, that the two oldest, greatest, most inveterate,
and most widely-spread evils which have ever been
known, are constantly, though, on the whole, slowly,
diminishing; and that their diminution has been
effected, not at all by moral feelings, nor by moral teachings,
but solely by the activity of the human intellect,
and by the inventions and discoveries which, in a long
course of successive ages, man has been able to make.</p>

<p>Since, then, in the two most important phenomena
which the progress of society presents, the moral laws
have been steadily and invariably subordinate to the
intellectual laws, there arises a strong presumption that
in inferior matters the same process has been followed.
To prove this in its full extent, and thus raise the presumption
to an absolute certainty, would be to write,
not an Introduction to history, but the History itself.
The reader must, therefore, be satisfied for the present
with what, I am conscious, is merely an approach
towards demonstration; and the complete demonstration
must necessarily be reserved for the future
volumes of this work: in which I pledge myself
to show that the progress Europe has made from
barbarism to civilization is entirely due to its intellectual
activity; that the leading countries have
now, for some centuries, advanced sufficiently far to
shake off the influence of those physical agencies by
which in an earlier state their career might have been
troubled; and that although the moral agencies are
still powerful, and still cause occasional disturbances,
these are but aberrations, which, if we compare long
periods of time, balance each other, and thus in the
total amount entirely disappear. So that, in a great
and comprehensive view, the changes in every civilized
people are, in their aggregate, dependent solely on
three things: first, on the amount of knowledge possessed
by their ablest men; secondly, on the direction
which that knowledge takes, that is to say, the sort of
subjects to which it refers: thirdly, and above all, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the extent to which the knowledge is diffused, and the
freedom with which it pervades all classes of society.</p>

<p>These are the three great movers of every civilized
country; and although their operation is frequently disturbed
by the vices or the virtues of powerful individuals,
such moral feelings correct each other, and the average
of long periods remains unaffected. Owing to causes of
which we are ignorant, the moral qualities do, no doubt,
constantly vary; so that in one man, or perhaps even
in one generation, there will be an excess of good intentions;
in another an excess of bad ones. But we
have no reason to think that any permanent change
has been effected in the proportion which those who
naturally possess good intentions bear to those in whom
bad ones seem to be inherent. In what may be called
the innate and original morals of mankind, there is, so
far as we are aware, no progress. Of the different
passions with which we are born, some are more prevalent
at one time, some at another; but experience
teaches us that, as they are always antagonistic,
they are held in balance by the force of their own
opposition. The activity of one motive is corrected
by the activity of another. For to every vice there
is a corresponding virtue. Cruelty is counteracted
by benevolence; sympathy is excited by suffering;
the injustice of some provokes the charity of others;
new evils are met by new remedies, and even the most
enormous offences that have ever been known have
left behind them no permanent impression. The
desolation of countries and the slaughter of men are
losses which never fail to be repaired, and at the distance
of a few centuries every vestige of them is effaced.
The gigantic crimes of Alexander or Napoleon become
after a time void of effect, and the affairs of the world
return to their former level. This is the ebb and flow
of history, the perpetual flux to which by the laws of
our nature we are subject. Above all this, there is a
far higher movement; and as the tide rolls on, now
advancing, now receding, there is, amid its endless fluctuations,
one thing, and one alone, which endures for
ever. The actions of bad men produce only temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
evil, the actions of good men only temporary good;
and eventually the good and the evil altogether subside,
are neutralized by subsequent generations, absorbed
by the incessant movements of future ages. But the
discoveries of great men never leave us; they are immortal,
they contain those eternal truths which survive
the shock of empires, outlive the struggles of rival
creeds, and witness the decay of successive religions.
All these have their different measures and their different
standards; one set of opinions for one age,
another set for another. They pass away like a dream;
they are as the fabric of a vision, which leaves not a
rack behind. The discoveries of genius alone remain:
it is to them we owe all that we now have, they
are for all ages and all times; never young, and never
old, they bear the seeds of their own life; they flow
on in a perennial and undying stream; they are essentially
cumulative, and, giving birth to the additions
which they subsequently receive, they thus influence
the most distant posterity, and after the lapse of centuries
produce more effect than they were able to do
even at the moment of their promulgation.</p>

has been studied, it is remarkable how little the physiologists have
contributed towards the great and final object of all science, namely,
the power of predicting events. To me it appears that the two principal
causes of this are, the backwardness of chemistry, and the still
extremely imperfect state of the microscope, which even now is so
inaccurate an instrument, that when a high power is employed, little
confidence can be placed in it; and the examination, for instance, of
the spermatozoa has led to the most contradictory results. In regard to
chemistry, MM. Robin and Verdeil, in their recent great work, have ably
proved what manifold relations there are between it and the further
progress of our knowledge of the animal frame; though I venture to think
that these eminent writers have shown occasionally an undue disposition
to limit the application of chemical laws to physiological phenomena.
See <i>Robin et Verdeil</i>, <i>Chimie Anatomique et Physiologique</i>, Paris,
1853, vol. i. pp. 20, 34, 167, 337, 338, 437, 661, vol. ii. pp. 136,
137, 508, vol. iii. pp. 135, 144, 183, 281, 283, 351, 547. The
increasing tendency of chemistry to bring under its control what are
often supposed to be purely organic phenomena, is noticed cautiously in
<i>Turner's Chemistry</i>, vol. ii. p. 1308, London, 1847; and boldly in
<i>Liebig's Letters on Chemistry</i>, 1851, pp. 250, 251. The connexion
between chemistry and physiology is touched on rather too hastily in
<i>Bouilland</i>, <i>Philosophie Médicale</i>, pp. 160, 257; <i>Broussais</i>, <i>Examen
des Doctrines Médicales</i>, vol. iii. p. 166; <i>Brodie's Lectures on
Pathology</i>, p. 48; <i>Henle</i>, <i>Traité d'Anatomie</i>, vol. i. pp. 25, 26;
<i>Feuchtersleben's Medical Psychology</i>, p. 88; but better in <i>Holland's
Medical Notes</i>, 1839, p. 270, a thoughtful and suggestive work. On the
necessity of chemistry for increasing our knowledge of embryology,
compare <i>Wagner's Physiology</i>, pp. 131, 132 note, with <i>Burdach</i>,
<i>Traité de Physiologie</i>, vol. iv. pp. 59, 168.</p></div>

authority, it is said, that &lsquo;the causes which determine the sex of the
embryo are unknown, although it appears that the relative age of the
parents has some influence over the sex of the offspring.&rsquo; That the
relative age of the parents does affect the sex of their children, may,
from the immense amount of evidence now collected, be considered almost
certain; but M. Müller, instead of referring to physiological writers,
ought to have mentioned that the statisticians, and not the
physiologists, were the first to make this discovery. On this curious
question, see <i>Carpenter's Human Physiology</i>, p. 746; <i>Sadler's Law of
Population</i>, vol. ii. pp. 333, 336, 342; <i>Journal of Statistical
Society</i>, vol. iii. pp. 263, 264. In regard to animals below man, we
find from numerous experiments, that among sheep and horses the age of
the parents &lsquo;has a very great general influence upon the sex&rsquo; of the
offspring. <i>Elliotson's Physiology</i>, pp. 708, 709; and see <i>Cuvier</i>,
<i>Progrès des Sciences Naturelles</i>, vol. ii. p. 406. As to the relation

because they are capable of transmission, is a favourite doctrine with
the followers of Gall, and is adopted by M. A. Comte (<i>Philosophie
Positive</i>, vol. iv. pp. 384, 385); who, whoever, admits that it has
never been sufficiently verified: &lsquo;sans que toutefois l'expérience ait
encore suffisamment prononcé.&rsquo; Dr. Prichard, whose habits of thought
were very different, seems, nevertheless, inclined to lean in this
direction; for his comparison of skulls led him to the conclusion, that
the present inhabitants of Britain, &lsquo;either as the <i>result of many ages
of greater intellectual cultivation</i>, or from some other cause, have, as
I am persuaded, much more capacious braincases than their
forefathers.&rsquo; <i>Prichard's Physical History of Mankind</i>, vol. i. p. 305.
Even if this were certain, it would not prove that the contents of the
crania were altered, though it might create a presumption; and the
general question must, I think, remain unsettled until the researches
begun by Blumenbach, and recently continued by Morton, are carried out
upon a scale far more comprehensive than has hitherto been attempted.

Latterly, attention has been paid to the chemistry of the blood as it
varies in the various temperaments; and this seems a more satisfactory
method than the old plan of merely describing the obvious symptoms of
the temperament. <i>Clark on Animal Physiology</i>, in <i>Fourth Report of the
British Association</i>, p. 126; <i>Simon's Animal Chemistry</i>, vol. i. p.
236; <i>Wagner's Physiology</i>, p. 262.</p></div>

hereditary virtues; but whoever will critically examine the evidence
will find that we have no proof of their existence. The way in which
they are commonly proved is in the highest degree illogical; the usual
course being for writers to collect instances of some mental peculiarity
found in a parent and in his child, and then to infer that the
peculiarity was bequeathed. By this mode of reasoning we might
demonstrate any proposition; since in all large fields of inquiry there
are a sufficient number of empirical coincidences to make a plausible
case in favour of whatever view a man chooses to advocate. But this is
not the way in which truth is discovered; and we ought to inquire not
only how many instances there are of hereditary talents, &amp;c. but how
many instances there are of such qualities not being hereditary. Until
something of this sort is attempted, we can know nothing about the
matter inductively: while, until physiology and chemistry are much more
advanced, we can know nothing about it deductively.
</p>
<p>
These considerations ought to prevent us from receiving statements
(<i>Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence</i>, pp. 644, 678, and many other books)
which positively affirm the existence of hereditary madness and
hereditary suicide; and the same remark applies to hereditary disease
(on which see some admirable observations in <i>Phillips on Scrofula</i>, pp.
101&ndash;120, London, 1846); and with still greater force does it apply to
hereditary vices and hereditary virtues; inasmuch as ethical phenomena
have not been registered as carefully as physiological ones, and
therefore our conclusions respecting them are even more precarious.</p></div>

contained no maxim which had not been previously enunciated, and that
some of the most beautiful passages in the Apostolic writings are
quotations from pagan authors, is well known to every scholar; and so
far from supplying, as some suppose, an objection against Christianity,
it is a strong recommendation of it, as indicating the intimate relation
between the doctrines of Christ and the moral sympathies of mankind in
different ages. But to assert that Christianity communicated to man
moral truths previously unknown, argues, on the part of the assertor,
either gross ignorance or else wilful fraud. For evidence of the
knowledge of moral truths possessed by barbarous nations, independently
of Christianity, and for the most part previous to its promulgation,

native kindliness of disposition
was not hardened or embittered
by the severity or the pride of
his philosophy. With Aurelius,
nevertheless, Christianity found
not only a fair and high-minded
competitor for the command of
the human mind; not only a
rival in the exaltation of the
soul of man to higher views and
more dignified motives; but a
violent and intolerant persecutor.&rsquo;
M. Guizot compares him
with Louis IX. of France; and
certainly there was in both an
evident connexion between sincerity

burned. <i>Prescott's History of Ferdinand and Isabella</i>, vol. i. p. 265.

moral and religious principles; in which case it would be possible for
the principles to be stationary, and yet their effects be progressive.
But so far from this, it is certain that in the Middle Ages there were,
relatively to the population, more churches than there are now; the
spiritual classes were far more numerous, the proselyting spirit far
more eager, and there was a much stronger determination to prevent
purely scientific inferences from encroaching on ethical ones. Indeed,
during the Middle Ages, the moral and religious literature outweighed
all the profane literature put together; and surpassed it, not only in
bulk, but also in the ability of its cultivators. Now, however, the
generalizations of moralists have ceased to control the affairs of men,
and have made way for the larger doctrine of expediency, which includes
all interests and all classes. Systematic writers on morals reached
their zenith in the thirteenth century, fell off rapidly after that
period, were, as Coleridge well says, opposed by &lsquo;the genius of
Protestantism:&rsquo; and, by the end of the seventeenth century, became
extinct in the most civilized countries; the <i>Ductor Dubitantium</i> of
Jeremy Taylor being the last comprehensive attempt of a man of genius to
mould society solely according to the maxims of moralists. Compare two
interesting passages in <i>Mosheim's Ecclesiast. Hist.</i>, vol. i. p. 338,
and <i>Coleridge's Friend</i>, vol. iii. p. 104.</p></div>

added that of wealth; and in Europe, during the Middle Ages, war was a
very lucrative profession, owing to the custom of exacting heavy ransom
for the liberty of prisoners. See Barrington's learned work,
<i>Observations on the Statutes</i>, pp. 390&ndash;393. In the reign of Richard II.
&lsquo;a war with France was esteemed as almost the only method by which an
English gentleman could become rich.&rsquo; Compare <i>Turner's Hist. of
England</i>, vol. vi. p. 21. Sainte Palaye (<i>Mémoires sur l'ancienne
Chevalerie</i>, vol. i. p. 311) says, &lsquo;La guerre enrichissoit alors par le

this, see <i>Rig Veda Sanhita</i>, vol. i. p. 208, sec. 3, and vol. ii. p.
265, sec. 13. In Europe, the custom of paying a ransom for

century, see <i>Relations des Ambassadeurs Vénitiens</i>, vol. i. pp. 94,

some doubt as to the exact period in which cannons were first known; but
they were certainly used in war before the middle of the fourteenth
century. See <i>Bohlen</i>, <i>das alte Indien</i>, vol. ii. p. 63; <i>Daniel</i>,

is very remarkable. Adam Smith (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, book v. chap. i. p.
291) says, &lsquo;Among the civilized nations of modern Europe, it is commonly
computed, that not more than the one-hundredth part of the inhabitants
of any country can be employed as soldiers, without ruin to the country
which pays the expense of their service.&rsquo; The same proportion is given
in <i>Sadler's Law of Population</i>, vol. i. p. 292; and in <i>Grandeur et

&lsquo;Discourse,&rsquo; written in 1578, and printed in <i>Stow's London</i>, in which
it is laid down, that if our exports exceed our imports, we gain by the
trade; but that, if they are less, we lose. <i>Stow's London</i>, edit.
Thoms, 1842, p. 205. Whenever this balance was disturbed, politicians
were thrown into an agony of fear. In 1620, James I. said, in one of his
long speeches, &lsquo;It's strange that my Mint hath not gone this eight or
nine years; but I think the fault of the want of money is the uneven
balancing of trade.&rsquo; <i>Parl. History</i>, vol. i. p. 1179; see also the
debate &lsquo;On the Scarcity of Money,&rsquo; pp. 1194&ndash;1196. In 1620, the House of
Commons, in a state of great alarm, passed a resolution, &lsquo;That the
importation of tobacco out of Spain is one reason of the scarcity of
money in this kingdom.&rsquo; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. i. p. 1198. In 1627, it was
actually argued in the House of Commons that the Netherlands were being
weakened by their trade with the East Indies, because it carried money
out of the country! <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. ii. p. 220. Half a century later,
the same principle was advocated by Sir William Temple in his Letters,
and also in his Observations upon the United Provinces. <i>Temple's

Chancellor, announced that the time had come when the English must go to
war with the Dutch; for that it was &lsquo;impossible both should stand upon a
balance; and that, if we do not master their trade, they will ours. They
or we must truckle. One must and will give the law to the other. There
is no compounding, where the contest is for the trade of the whole
world.&rsquo; <i>Somers' Tracts</i>, vol. viii. p. 39. A few months later, still
insisting on the propriety of the war, he gave as one of his reasons
that it &lsquo;was necessary to the trade of England that there should be a
fair adjustment of commerce in the East Indies.&rsquo; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. iv.
p. 587. In 1701, Stepney, a diplomatist and one of the lords of trade,
published an essay, strongly insisting on the benefits which would
accrue to English commerce by a war with France. <i>Somers' Tracts</i>, vol.
xi. pp. 199, 217; and he says, p. 205, that one of the consequences of
peace with France would be &lsquo;the utter ruin and destruction of our
trade.&rsquo; See also, in vol. xiii. p. 688, the remarks on the policy of
William III. In 1743, Lord Hardwicke, one of the most eminent men of his
time, said, in the House of Lords, &lsquo;If our wealth is diminished, it is
time to ruin the commerce of that nation which has driven us from the
markets of the Continent&mdash;by sweeping the seas of their ships, and by
blockading their ports.&rsquo; <i>Campbell's Lives of the Chancellors</i>, vol. v.

on Money</i>, in <i>Locke's Works</i>, vol. iv.; and in particular pp. 9, 10,
12, 20, 21, 49&ndash;52. Berkeley, profound thinker as he was, fell into the

trade, and lessening our imports in proportion as we lessen our exports.

the mischievous interference of the English government, which he
recommends as a pattern to other states.</p></div>

But I believe that the earliest approach towards modern economical
discoveries is a striking essay published in 1581, and ascribed to
William Stafford. It will be found in the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>, vol.
ix. pp. 139&ndash;192, edit. Park, 1812; and the title, <i>Brief Conceipt of
English Policy</i>, gives an inadequate idea of what is, on the whole, the
most important work on the theory of politics which had then appeared:
since the author not only displays an insight into the nature of price
and value, such as no previous thinker possessed, but he points out
clearly the causes of that system of enclosures which is the leading
economical fact in the reign of Elizabeth, and is intimately connected
with the rise of the poor-laws. Some account of this essay is given by
Dr. Twiss; but the original is easily accessible, and should be read by
every student of English history. Among other heretical propositions, it
recommends free trade in corn.</p></div>

it is stated by Mr. M'Culloch (<i>Polit. Econ.</i> p. 269), on the authority
of a committee of the House of Commons, that before the year 1820, &lsquo;no
fewer than two thousand laws with respect to commerce had been passed at
different periods.&rsquo; It may be confidently asserted, that every one of
those laws was an unmitigated evil, since no trade, and indeed no
interest of any kind, can be protected by government without inflicting
immeasurably greater loss upon the unprotected interests and trades;
while, if the protection is universal, the loss will be universal. Some
striking instances of the absurd laws which have been passed respecting
trade, are collected in <i>Barrington's Observations on the Statutes</i>, pp.
279&ndash;285. Indeed, it was considered necessary that every parliament
should do something in this way; and Charles II., in one of his
speeches, says, &lsquo;I pray, contrive any good short bills which may improve
the industry of the nation  &hellip; and so God bles your councils.&rsquo; <i>Parl.

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">INQUIRY INTO THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY RELIGION, LITERATURE, AND GOVERNMENT.</div>

<p>By applying to the history of Man those methods of
investigation which have been found successful in other
branches of knowledge, and by rejecting all preconceived
notions which would not bear the test of those methods,
we have arrived at certain results, the heads of which it
may now be convenient to recapitulate. We have seen
that our actions, being solely the result of internal and
external agencies, must be explicable by the laws of
those agencies; that is to say, by mental laws and by
physical laws. We have also seen that mental laws are,
in Europe, more powerful than physical laws; and that,
in the progress of civilization, their superiority is constantly
increasing, because advancing knowledge multiplies
the resources of the mind, but leaves the old resources
of nature stationary. On this account, we have treated
the mental laws as being the great regulators of progress;
and we have looked at the physical laws as occupying a
subordinate place, and as merely displaying themselves
in occasional disturbances, the force and frequency of
which have been long declining, and are now, on a large
average, almost inoperative. Having, by this means,
resolved the study of what may be called the dynamics
of society into the study of the laws of the mind, we have
subjected these last to a similar analysis; and we have
found that they consist of two parts, namely, moral laws
and intellectual laws. By comparing these two parts,
we have clearly ascertained the vast superiority of the
intellectual laws; and we have seen, that as the progress
of civilization is marked by the triumph of the mental
laws over the physical, just so is it marked by the triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of the intellectual laws over the moral ones. This important
inference rests on two distinct arguments. First,
that moral truths being stationary, and intellectual truths
being progressive, it is highly improbable that the progress
of society should be due to moral knowledge, which
for many centuries has remained the same, rather than
to intellectual knowledge, which for many centuries has
been incessantly advancing. The other argument consists
in the fact, that the two greatest evils known to
mankind have not been diminished by moral improvement;
but have been, and still are, yielding to the
influence of intellectual discoveries. From all this it
evidently follows, that if we wish to ascertain the conditions
which regulate the progress of modern civilization,
we must seek them in the history of the amount and
diffusion of intellectual knowledge; and we must consider
physical phenomena and moral principles as causing, no
doubt, great aberrations in short periods, but in long
periods correcting and balancing themselves, and thus
leaving the intellectual laws to act uncontrolled by these
inferior and subordinate agents.</p>

<p>Such is the conclusion to which we have been led by
successive analyses, and on which we now take our
stand. The actions of individuals are greatly affected
by their moral feelings and by their passions; but these
being antagonistic to the passions and feelings of other
individuals, are balanced by them; so that their effect
is, in the great average of human affairs, nowhere to be
seen; and the total actions of mankind, considered as a
whole, are left to be regulated by the total knowledge
of which mankind is possessed. And of the way in
which individual feeling and individual caprice are thus
absorbed and neutralized, we find a clear illustration in
the facts already brought forward respecting the history
of crime. For by those facts it is decisively proved, that
the amount of crime committed in a country is, year
after year, reproduced with the most startling uniformity,
not being in the least affected by those capricious and
personal feelings to which human actions are too often
referred. But if, instead of examining the history of
crime year by year, we were to examine it month by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
month, we should find less regularity; and if we were
to examine it hour by hour, we should find no regularity
at all; neither would its regularity be seen, if, instead
of the criminal records of a whole country, we only knew
those of a single street, or of a single family. This is
because the great social laws by which crime is governed,
can only be perceived after observing great numbers or
long periods; but in a small number, and a short period,
the individual moral principle triumphs, and disturbs
the operation of the larger and intellectual law. While,
therefore, the moral feelings by which a man is urged
to commit a crime, or to abstain from it, will produce an
immense effect on the amount of his own crimes, they
will produce no effect on the amount of crimes committed
by the society to which he belongs; because, in the long-run,
they are sure to be neutralized by opposite moral
feelings, which cause in other men an opposite conduct.
Just in the same way, we are all sensible that moral
principles do affect nearly the whole of our actions; but
we have incontrovertible proof that they produce not
the least effect on mankind in the aggregate, or even on
men in very large masses, provided that we take the precaution
of studying social phenomena for a period sufficiently
long, and on a scale sufficiently great, to enable
the superior laws to come into uncontrolled operation.</p>

<p>The totality of human actions being thus, from the
highest point of view, governed by the totality of human
knowledge, it might seem a simple matter to collect the
evidence of the knowledge, and, by subjecting it to successive
generalizations, ascertain the whole of the laws
which regulate the progress of civilization. And that
this will be eventually done, I do not entertain the slightest
doubt. But, unfortunately, history has been written
by men so inadequate to the great task they have undertaken,
that few of the necessary materials have yet been
brought together. Instead of telling us those things
which alone have any value,&mdash;instead of giving us information
respecting the progress of knowledge, and the
way in which mankind has been affected by the diffusion
of that knowledge,&mdash;instead of these things, the vast majority
of historians fill their works with the most trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and miserable details: personal anecdotes of kings and
courts; interminable relations of what was said by one
minister, and what was thought by another; and, what is
worse than all, long accounts of campaigns, battles, and
sieges, very interesting to those engaged in them, but
to us utterly useless, because they neither furnish new
truths, nor do they supply the means by which new
truths may be discovered. This is the real impediment
which now stops our advance. It is this want of judgment,
and this ignorance of what is most worthy of
selection, which deprives us of materials that ought long
since to have been accumulated, arranged, and stored-up
for future use. In other great branches of knowledge,
observation has preceded discovery; first the facts have
been registered, and then their laws have been found.
But in the study of the history of Man, the important
facts have been neglected, and the unimportant ones
preserved. The consequence is, that whoever now attempts
to generalize historical phenomena must collect
the facts, as well as conduct the generalization. He finds
nothing ready to his hand. He must be the mason as
well as the architect; he must not only scheme the edifice,
but likewise excavate the quarry. The necessity of performing
this double labour entails upon the philosopher
such enormous drudgery, that the limits of an entire life
are unequal to the task; and history, instead of being
ripe, as it ought to be, for complete and exhaustive
generalizations, is still in so crude and informal a state,
that not the most determined and protracted industry
will enable any one to comprehend the really important
actions of mankind, during even so short a period as two
successive centuries.</p>

<p>On account of these things, I have long since abandoned
my original scheme; and I have reluctantly determined
to write the history, not of general civilization,
but of the civilization of a single people. While, however,
by this means, we curtail the field of inquiry, we
unfortunately diminish the resources of which the inquiry
is possessed. For although it is perfectly true, that the
totality of human actions, if considered in long periods,
depends on the totality of human knowledge, it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
allowed that this great principle, when applied only to
one country, loses something of its original value. The
more we diminish our observations, the greater becomes
the uncertainty of the average; in other words, the
greater the chance of the operation of the larger laws
being troubled by the operation of the smaller. The
interference of foreign governments; the influence exercised
by the opinions, literature, and customs of a foreign
people; their invasions, perhaps even their conquests;
the forcible introduction by them of new religions, new
laws, and new manners,&mdash;all these things are perturbations,
which, in a view of universal history, equalize each
other, but which, in any one country, are apt to disturb
the natural march, and thus render the movements of
civilization more difficult to calculate. The manner in
which I have endeavoured to meet this difficulty will be
presently stated; but what I first wish to point out, are
the reasons which have induced me to select the history
of England as more important than any other, and therefore
as the most worthy of being subjected to a complete
and philosophic investigation.</p>

<p>Now, it is evident that, inasmuch as the great advantage
of studying past events consists in the possibility
of ascertaining the laws by which they were governed,
the history of any people will become more valuable in
proportion as their movements have been least disturbed
by agencies not arising from themselves. Every foreign
or external influence which is brought to bear upon a
nation is an interference with its natural development,
and therefore complicates the circumstances we seek to
investigate. To simplify complications, is, in all branches
of knowledge, the first essential of success. This is very
familiar to the cultivators of physical science, who are
often able, by a single experiment, to discover a truth
which innumerable observations had vainly searched;
the reason being, that by experimenting on phenomena,
we can disentangle them from their complications; and
thus isolating them from the interference of unknown
agencies, we leave them, as it were, to run their own
course, and disclose the operation of their own law.</p>

<p>This, then, is the true standard by which we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
measure the value of the history of any nation. The
importance of the history of a country depends, not upon
the splendour of its exploits, but upon the degree to
which its actions are due to causes springing out of itself.
If, therefore, we could find some civilized people who
had worked out their civilization entirely by themselves;
who had escaped all foreign influence, and who had been
neither benefited nor retarded by the personal peculiarities
of their rulers,&mdash;the history of such a people would
be of paramount importance; because it would present
a condition of normal and inherent development; it would
show the laws of progress acting in a state of isolation;
it would be, in fact, an experiment ready-made, and
would possess all the value of that artificial contrivance
to which natural science is so much indebted.</p>

<p>To find such a people as this is obviously impossible;
but the duty of the philosophic historian is, to select
for his especial study the country in which the conditions
have been most closely followed. Now, it will be readily
admitted, not only by ourselves, but by intelligent foreigners,
that in England, during, at all events, the last
three centuries, this has been done more constantly and
more successfully than in any other country. I say nothing
of the number of our discoveries, the brilliancy of
our literature, or the success of our arms. These are
invidious topics; and other nations may perhaps deny
to us those superior merits which we are apt to exaggerate.
But I take up this single position, that of all
European countries, England is the one where, during
the longest period, the government has been most
quiescent, and the people most active; where popular
freedom has been settled on the widest basis; where each
man is most able to say what he thinks, and do what he
likes; where every one can follow his own bent, and
propagate his own opinions; where, religious persecution
being little known, the play and flow of the human mind
may be clearly seen, unchecked by those restraints to
which it is elsewhere subjected; where the profession of
heresy is least dangerous, and the practice of dissent
most common; where hostile creeds flourish side by
side, and rise and decay without disturbance, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to the wants of the people, unaffected by the wishes of
the church, and uncontrolled by the authority of the
state; where all interests, and all classes, both spiritual
and temporal, are most left to take care of themselves;
where that meddlesome doctrine called Protection was
first attacked, and where alone it has been destroyed;
and where, in a word, those dangerous extremes to which
interference gives rise having been avoided, despotism
and rebellion are equally rare, and concession being recognized
as the groundwork of policy, the national progress
has been least disturbed by the power of privileged
classes, by the influence of particular sects, or by the
violence of arbitrary rulers.</p>

<p>That these are the characteristics of English history
is notorious; to some men a matter of boast, to others
of regret. And when to these circumstances we add,
that England, owing to its insular formation,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> was,
until the middle of the last century, rarely visited by
foreigners, it becomes evident that, in our progress as
a people, we have been less affected than any other
by the two main sources of interference, namely, the
authority of government, and the influence of foreigners.
In the sixteenth century, it became a fashion, among
the English nobility, to travel abroad;<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> but it was by
no means the fashion for foreign nobility to travel in
England. In the seventeenth century, the custom of
travelling for amusement spread so much, that, among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the rich and idle classes, there were few Englishmen
who did not, at least once in their life, cross the Channel;
while the same classes in other countries, partly
because they were less wealthy, partly from an inveterate
dislike to the sea, hardly ever entered our island,
unless compelled to do so on some particular business.
The result was, that in other countries, and particularly
in France and Italy, the inhabitants of the great cities
became gradually accustomed to foreigners, and, like
all men, were imperceptibly influenced by what they
often saw. On the other hand, there were many of
our cities in which none but Englishmen ever set their
feet;<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and inhabitants, even of the metropolis, might
grow old without having once seen a single foreigner,
except, perhaps, some dull and pompous ambassador
taking his airing on the banks of the Thames. And
although it is often said that, after the restoration of
Charles II., our national character began to be greatly
influenced by French example,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> this, as I shall fully
prove, was confined to that small and insignificant part
of society which hung about the court; nor did it produce
any marked effect upon the two most important
classes,&mdash;the intellectual class, and the industrious
class. The movement may, indeed, be traced in the
most worthless parts of our literature,&mdash;in the shameless
productions of Buckingham, Dorset, Etherege,
Killigrew, Mulgrave, Rochester, and Sedley. But
neither then, nor at a much later period, were any
of our great thinkers influenced by the intellect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
France;<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> on the contrary, we find in their ideas, and
even in their style, a certain rough and native vigour,
which, though offensive to our more polished neighbours,
has at least the merit of being the indigenous
product of our own country.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> The origin and extent
of that connexion between the French and English
intellects which subsequently arose, is a subject of
immense importance; but, like most others of real
value, it has been entirely neglected by historians. In
the present work, I shall attempt to supply this deficiency:
in the mean time I may say, that although we
have been, and still are, greatly indebted to the French
for our improvement in taste, in refinement, in manners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and indeed in all the amenities of life, we have borrowed
from them nothing absolutely essential, nothing
by which the destinies of nations are permanently
altered. On the other hand, the French have not only
borrowed from us some very valuable political institutions,
but even the most important event in French
history is due, in no small degree, to our influence.
Their revolution of 1789 was, as is well known, brought
about, or, to speak more properly, was mainly instigated,
by a few great men, whose works, and afterwards
whose speeches, roused the people to resistance;
but what is less known, and nevertheless is certainly
true, is, that these eminent leaders learnt in England
that philosophy and those principles by which, when
transplanted into their own country, such fearful and
yet such salutary results were effected.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>It will not, I hope, be supposed, that by these remarks
I mean to cast any reflection on the French: a
great and admirable people; a people in many respects
superior to ourselves; a people from whom we have
still much to learn, and whose deficiencies, such as
they are, arise from the perpetual interference of a long
line of arbitrary rulers. But, looking at this matter
historically, it is unquestionably true that we have
worked out our civilization with little aid from them,
while they have worked out theirs with great aid from
us. At the same time, it must also be admitted, that
our governments have interfered less with us than their
governments have interfered with them. And without
in the least prejudging the question as to which is the
greater country, it is solely on these grounds that I
consider our history more important than theirs: and
I select for especial study the progress of English
civilization, simply because, being less affected by
agencies not arising from itself, we can the more
clearly discern in it the normal march of society, and
the undisturbed operation of those great laws by which
the fortunes of mankind are ultimately regulated.</p>

<p>After this comparison between the relative value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
French and English history, it seems scarcely necessary
to examine the claims which may be put forward for
the history of other countries. Indeed, there are only
two in whose favour any thing can be said: I mean
Germany, considered as a whole, and the United States
of North America. As to the Germans, it is undoubtedly
true, that since the middle of the eighteenth
century they have produced a greater number of profound
thinkers than any other country, I might perhaps
say, than all other countries put together. But the
objections which apply to the French are still more
applicable to the Germans. For the protective principle
has been, and still is, stronger in Germany than in
France. Even the best of the German governments
are constantly interfering with the people; never leaving
them to themselves, always looking after their
interests, and meddling in the commonest affairs of
daily life. Besides this, the German literature, though
now the first in Europe, owes it origin, as we shall
hereafter see, to that great sceptical movement, by
which, in France, the Revolution was preceded. Before
the middle of the eighteenth century, the Germans,
notwithstanding a few eminent names, such as Kepler
and Leibnitz, had no literature of real value; and the
first impetus which they received, was caused by their
contact with the French intellect, and by the influence
of those eminent Frenchmen who, in the reign of
Frederick the Great, flocked to Berlin,<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> a city which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
has ever since been the head-quarters of philosophy
and science. From this there have resulted some very
important circumstances, which I can here only briefly
indicate. The German intellect, stimulated by the
French into a sudden growth, has been irregularly
developed; and thus hurried into an activity greater
than the average civilization of the country requires.
The consequence is, that there is no nation in Europe
in which we find so wide an interval between the
highest minds and the lowest minds. The German
philosophers possess a learning, and a reach of thought,
which places them at the head of the civilized world.
The German people are more superstitious, more prejudiced,
and, notwithstanding the care which the
government takes of their education, more really ignorant,
and more unfit to guide themselves, than are the
inhabitants either of France or of England.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
separation and divergence of the two classes is the
natural result of that artificial stimulus, which a century
ago was administered to one of the classes, and
which thus disturbed the normal proportions of society.
Owing to this, the highest intellects have, in Germany,
so outstripped the general progress of the nation, that
there is no sympathy between the two parties; nor are
there at present any means by which they may be
brought into contact. Their great authors address
themselves, not to their country, but to each other.
They are sure of a select and learned audience, and
they use what, in reality, is a learned language; they
turn their mother-tongue into a dialect, eloquent indeed,
and very powerful, but so difficult, so subtle, and
so full of complicated inversions, that to their own
lower classes it is utterly incomprehensible.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
this, there have arisen some of the most marked peculiarities
of German literature. For, being deprived of
ordinary readers, it is cut off from the influence of
ordinary prejudice; and hence, it has displayed a boldness
of inquiry, a recklessness in the pursuit of truth
and a disregard of traditional opinions, which entitle
it to the highest praise. But, on the other hand, this
same circumstance has produced that absence of practical
knowledge, and that indifference to material and
physical interests, for which the German literature is
justly censured. As a matter of course, all this has
widened the original breach, and increased the distance
which separates the great German thinkers from that
dull and plodding class, which, though it lies immediately
beneath them, still remains uninfluenced by
their knowledge, and uncheered by the glow and fire
of their genius.</p>

<p>In America, on the other hand, we see a civilization
precisely the reverse of this. We see a country, of
which it has been truly said, that in no other are there
so few men of great learning, and so few men of great
ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> In Germany, the speculative classes and
the practical classes are altogether disunited; in America,
they are altogether fused. In Germany, nearly
every year brings forward new discoveries, new philosophies,
new means by which the boundaries of
knowledge are to be enlarged. In America, such inquiries
are almost entirely neglected: since the time
of Jonathan Edwards no great metaphysician has
appeared; little attention has been paid to physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
science; and, with the single exception of jurisprudence,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
scarcely anything has been done for those vast
subjects on which the Germans are incessantly labouring.
The stock of American knowledge is small, but
it is spread through all classes; the stock of German
knowledge is immense, but it is confined to one class.
Which of these two forms of civilization is the more
advantageous, is a question we are not now called upon
to decide. It is enough for our present purpose, that
in Germany, there is a serious failure in the diffusion
of knowledge; and, in America, a no less serious one
in its accumulation. And as civilization is regulated
by the accumulation and diffusion of knowledge, it is
evident that no country can even approach to a complete
and perfect pattern, if, cultivating one of these
conditions to an excess, it neglects the cultivation of
the other. Indeed, from this want of balance and
equilibrium between the two elements of civilization,
there have arisen in America and in Germany those
great but opposite evils, which, it is to be feared, will
not be easily remedied; and which, until remedied,
will certainly retard the progress of both countries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
notwithstanding the temporary advantages which such
one-sided energy does for the moment always procure.</p>

<p>I have very briefly, but I hope fairly, and certainly
with no conscious partiality, endeavoured to estimate
the relative value of the history of the four leading
countries of the world. As to the real greatness of the
countries themselves, I offer no opinion; because each
considers itself to be first. But, unless the facts I have
stated can be controverted, it certainly follows, that
the history of England is, to the philosopher, more
valuable than any other; because he can more clearly
see in it the accumulation and diffusion of knowledge
going hand-in-hand; because that knowledge has been
less influenced by foreign and external agencies; and
because it has been less interfered with, either for good
or for evil, by those powerful, but frequently incompetent
men, to whom the administration of public affairs is
entrusted.</p>

<p>It is on account of these considerations, and not at
all from those motives which are dignified with the
name of patriotism, that I have determined to write the
history of my own country, in preference to that of
any other; and to write it in a manner as complete, and
as exhaustive, as the materials which are now extant
will enable me to do. But, inasmuch as the circumstances
already stated, render it impossible to discover
the laws of society solely by studying the history of a
single nation, I have drawn up the present Introduction
in order to obviate some of the difficulties with which
this great subject is surrounded. In the earlier chapters,
I have attempted to mark out the limits of the
subject considered as a whole, and fix the largest possible
basis upon which it can rest. With this view, I
have looked at civilization as broken into two vast
divisions: the European division, in which Man is
more powerful than Nature; and the non-European
division, in which Nature is more powerful than Man.
This has led us to the conclusion, that national progress,
in connexion with popular liberty, could have
originated in no part of the world except in Europe;
where, therefore, the rise of real civilization, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
encroachments of the human mind upon the forces of
nature, are alone to be studied. The superiority of the
mental laws over the physical, being thus recognized
as the groundwork of European history, the next step
has been, to resolve the mental laws into moral and
intellectual, and prove the superior influence of the
intellectual ones in accelerating the progress of Man.
These generalizations appear to me the essential preliminaries
of history, considered as a science; and, in
order to connect them with the special history of
England, we have now merely to ascertain the fundamental
condition of intellectual progress, as, until that
is done, the annals of any people can only present an
empirical succession of events, connected by such stray
and casual links as are devised by different writers,
according to their different principles. The remaining
part of this Introduction will, therefore, be chiefly
occupied in completing the scheme I have sketched,
by investigating the history of various countries in reference
to those intellectual peculiarities on which the
history of our own country supplies no adequate information.
Thus, for instance, in Germany, the accumulation
of knowledge has been far more rapid than in
England; the laws of the accumulation of knowledge
may, on that account, be most conveniently studied in
German history, and then applied deductively to the
history of England. In the same way, the Americans
have diffused their knowledge much more completely
than we have done; I, therefore, purpose to explain
some of the phenomena of English civilization by those
laws of diffusion, of which, in American civilization,
the workings may be most clearly seen, and hence the
discovery most easily made. Again, inasmuch as France
is the most civilized country in which the protective
spirit is very powerful, we may trace the occult tendencies
of that spirit among ourselves, by studying its
obvious tendencies among our neighbours. With this
view, I shall give an account of French history, in
order to illustrate the protective principle, by showing
the injury it has inflicted on a very able and enlightened
people. And, in an analysis of the French Revolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
I shall point out how that great event was a reaction
against the protective spirit; while, as the materials
for the reaction were drawn from England, we shall
also see in it the way in which the intellect of
one country acts upon the intellect of another; and
we shall arrive at some results respecting that interchange
of ideas which is likely to become the most
important regulator of European affairs. This will
throw much light on the laws of international thought;
and, in connexion with it, two separate chapters will
be devoted to a History of the Protective Spirit, and
an Examination of its relative intensity in France and
England. But the French, as a people, have, since the
beginning or middle of the seventeenth century, been
remarkably free from superstition; and, notwithstanding
the efforts of their government, they are very averse
to ecclesiastical power: so that, although their history
displays the protective principle in its political form, it
supplies little evidence respecting its religious form;
while, in our own country, the evidence is also scanty.
Hence, my intention is, to give a view of Spanish
history; because in it we may trace the full results of
that protection against error which the spiritual classes
are always eager to afford. In Spain, the church has,
from a very early period, possessed more authority, and
the clergy have been more influential, both with the
people and the government, than in any other country;
it will, therefore, be convenient to study in Spain the
laws of ecclesiastical development, and the manner in
which that development affects the national interests.
Another circumstance, which operates on the intellectual
progress of a nation, is the method of investigation
that its ablest men habitually employ. This method
can only be one of two kinds; it must be either inductive,
or deductive. Each of these belongs to a different
form of civilization, and is always accompanied by a
different style of thought, particularly in regard to
religion and science. These differences are of such
immense importance, that, until their laws are known,
we cannot be said to understand the real history of
past events. Now, the two extremes of the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
are, undoubtedly, Germany and the United States; the
Germans being pre-eminently deductive, the Americans
inductive. But Germany and America are, in so many
other respects, diametrically opposed to each other, that
I have thought it expedient to study the operations of
the deductive and inductive spirit in countries between
which a closer analogy exists; because the greater the
similarity between two nations, the more easily can we
trace the consequences of any single divergence, and the
more conspicuous do the laws of that divergence become.
Such an opportunity occurs in the history of
Scotland, as compared with that of England. Here we
have two nations, bordering on each other, speaking
the same language, reading the same literature, and
knit together by the same interests. And yet it is a
truth, which seems to have escaped attention, but the
proof of which I shall fully detail, that, until the last
thirty or forty years, the Scotch intellect has been even
more entirely deductive than the English intellect has
been inductive. The inductive tendencies of the English
mind, and the almost superstitious reverence with which
we cling to them, have been noticed with regret by a
few, and a very few, of our ablest men.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> On the other
hand, in Scotland, particularly during the eighteenth
century, the great thinkers, with hardly an exception,
adopted the deductive method. Now, the characteristic
of deduction, when applied to branches of knowledge
not yet ripe for it, is, that it increases the number
of hypotheses from which we reason downwards, and
brings into disrepute the slow and patient ascent
peculiar to inductive inquiry. This desire to grasp at
truth by speculative, and, as it were, foregone conclusions,
has often led the way to great discoveries; and
no one, properly instructed, will deny its immense
value. But when it is universally followed, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
imminent danger lest the observation of mere empirical
uniformities should be neglected; and lest thinking
men should grow impatient at those small and proximate
generalizations which, according to the inductive
scheme, must invariably precede the larger and higher
ones. Whenever this impatience actually occurs, there
is produced serious mischief. For these lower generalizations
form a neutral ground, which speculative minds
and practical minds possess in common, and on which
they meet. If this ground is cut away, the meeting is
impossible. In such case, there arises among the scientific
classes an undue contempt for inferences which
the experience of the vulgar has drawn, but of which
the laws seem inexplicable; while, among the practical
classes, there arises a disregard of speculations so wide,
so magnificent, and of which the intermediate and preliminary
steps are hidden from their gaze. The results
of this in Scotland are highly curious, and are, in
several respects, similar to those which we find in
Germany; since in both countries the intellectual classes
have long been remarkable for their boldness of investigation
and their freedom from prejudice, and the people
at large equally remarkable for the number of their
superstitions and the strength of their prejudices. In
Scotland this is even more striking than in Germany;
because the Scotch, owing to causes which have been
little studied, are, in practical matters, not only industrious
and provident, but singularly shrewd. This, however,
in the higher departments of life, has availed
them nothing; and, while there is no country which
possesses a more original, inquisitive, and innovating
literature than Scotland does, so also is there no country,
equally civilized, in which so much of the spirit of the
Middle Ages still lingers, in which so many absurdities
are still believed, and in which it would be so easy
to rouse into activity the old feelings of religious
intolerance.</p>

<p>The divergence, and indeed the hostility, thus established
between the practical and speculative classes,
is the most important fact in the history of Scotland,
and is partly cause and partly effect of the predominance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of the deductive method. For this descending
scheme being opposed to the ascending or inductive
scheme, neglects those lower generalizations which are
the only ones that both classes understand, and, therefore,
the only ones where they sympathize with each
other. The inductive method, as popularized by Bacon,
gave great prominence to these lower or proximate
truths; and this, though it has often made the intellectual
classes in England too utilitarian, has at all events
saved them from that state of isolation in which they
would otherwise have remained. But in Scotland the
isolation has been almost complete, because the deductive
method has been almost universal. Full evidence
of this will be collected in the third volume; but, that
I may not leave the subject entirely without illustration,
I will notice very briefly the principal instances
that occurred during those three generations in which
Scotch literature reached its highest excellence.</p>

<p>During this period, which comprises nearly a century,
the tendency was so unmistakable as to form a
striking phenomenon in the annals of the human mind.
The first great symptom was a movement begun by
Simson, professor at the University of Glasgow, and
continued by Stewart, professor at the University of
Edinburgh. These able men made strenuous efforts to
revive the pure Greek geometry, and depreciate the
algebraic or symbolical analysis.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Hence there arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
among them, and among their disciples, a love of the
most refined methods of solution, and a contempt for
those easier, but less elegant ones, which we owe to
algebra.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Here we clearly see the isolating and esoteric
character of a scheme which despises what
ordinary understandings can quickly master, and
which had rather proceed from the ideal to the tangible,
than mount from the tangible to the ideal. Just
at the same time, the same spirit was displayed, in
another branch of inquiry, by Hutcheson, who, though
an Irishman by birth, was educated in the University
of Glasgow, and was professor there. In his celebrated
moral and æsthetic researches, he, in the place of inductive
reasoning from palpable facts, substituted deductive
reasoning from impalpable principles; ignoring
the immediate and practical suggestions of the senses,
and believing that by a hypothetical assumption of
certain laws, he could descend upon the facts, instead
of rising from the facts in order to learn the laws.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
His philosophy exercised immense influence among
metaphysicians;<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> and his method of working downwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
from the abstract to the concrete, was adopted
by another and a still greater Scotchman, the illustrious
Adam Smith. How Smith favoured the deductive
form of investigation is apparent in his <i>Theory of
Moral Sentiments</i>, likewise in his <i>Essay on Language</i>,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
and even in his fragment on the <i>History of Astronomy</i>,
in which he, from general considerations, undertook to
prove what the march of astronomical discovery must
have been, instead of first ascertaining what it had
been.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, again, is entirely deductive,
since in it Smith generalizes the laws of wealth,
not from the phenomena of wealth, nor from statistical
statements, but from the phenomena of selfishness;
thus making a deductive application of one set of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
mental principles to the whole set of economical facts.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
The illustrations with which his great book abounds
are no part of the real argument: they are subsequent
to the conception; and if they were all admitted, the
work, though less interesting and perhaps less influential,
would, in a scientific point of view, be equally
valuable. To give another instance: the works of
Hume, his metaphysical essays alone excepted, are all
deductive; his profound economical inquiries are essentially
<i>a priori</i>, and might have been written without
any acquaintance with those details of trade and finance
from which, according to the inductive scheme, they
should have been generalized.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Thus, too, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
<i>Natural History of Religion</i>, he endeavoured simply by
reflection, and independently of evidence, to institute a
purely speculative investigation into the origin of
religious opinions.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> In the same way, in his <i>History
of England</i>, instead of first collecting the evidence, and
then drawing inferences from it, he began by assuming
that the relations between the people and the government
must have followed a certain order, and he either
neglected or distorted the facts by which this supposition
was contradicted.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> These different writers, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
varying in their principles, and in the subjects they
studied, were all agreed as to their method; that is to
say, they were all agreed to investigate truth rather by
descent than by ascent. The immense social importance
of this peculiarity I shall examine in the third
volume, where I shall endeavour to ascertain how it
affected the national civilization, and caused some
curious contrasts with the opposite, and more empirical,
character of English literature. In the meantime,
and merely to state what will be hereafter proved,
I may add, that the deductive method was employed,
not only by those eminent Scotchmen I have mentioned,
but was carried into the speculative <i>History of Civil
Society</i> by Ferguson; into the study of legislation by
Mill; into the study of jurisprudence by Mackintosh;
into geology by Hutton; into thermotics by Black and
Leslie; into physiology by Hunter, by Alexander
Walker, and by Charles Bell; into pathology by
Cullen; into therapeutics by Brown and Currie.</p>

<p>This is an outline of the plan I purpose to follow in
the present Introduction, and by means of which I hope
to arrive at some results of permanent value. For by
studying different principles in those countries where
they have been most developed, the laws of the principles
will be more easily unfolded than if we had
studied them in countries where they are very obscure.
And, inasmuch as, in England, civilization has followed
a course more orderly, and less disturbed, than in any
other country, it becomes the more necessary, in writing
its history, to use some resources like those which I
have suggested. What makes the history of England
so eminently valuable is, that nowhere else has the
national progress been so little interfered with, either
for good or for evil. But the mere fact that our civilization
has, by this means, been preserved in a more
natural and healthy state, renders it incumbent on us
to study the diseases to which it is liable, by observing
those other countries where social disease is more rife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
The security and the durability of civilization must
depend on the regularity with which its elements are
combined, and on the harmony with which they work.
If any one element is too active, the whole composition
will be in danger. Hence it is, that although the laws
of the composition of the elements will be best ascertained
wherever we can find the composition most
complete, we must, nevertheless, search for the laws
of each separate element wherever we can find the
element itself most active. While, therefore, I have
selected the history of England, as that in which the
harmony of the different principles has been longest
maintained, I have, precisely on that account, thought
it advisable to study each principle separately in the
country where it has been most powerful, and where,
by its inordinate development, the equilibrium of the
entire structure has been disturbed.</p>

<p>By adopting these precautions, we shall be able to
remove many of the difficulties which still beset the
study of history. Before, however, entering that wide
field which now lies in our way, it will be well to clear
up some preliminary points, which I have not yet
noticed, and the discussion of which may obviate certain
objections that might otherwise be raised. The
subjects to which I allude, are Religion, Literature,
and Government: three topics of vast importance, and
which, in the opinion of many persons, are the prime
movers of human affairs. That this opinion is altogether
erroneous will be amply proved in the present
work; but as the opinion is widely spread, and is very
plausible, it is necessary that we should at once come
to some understanding respecting it, and inquire into
the real nature of that influence, which these three
great powers do actually exercise over the progress of
civilization.</p>

<p>Now, in the first place, it is evident that if a people
were left entirely to themselves, their religion, their
literature, and their government would be, not the
causes of their civilization, but the effects of it. Out of
a certain condition of society certain results naturally
follow. Those results may, no doubt, be tampered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
by some external agency; but if that is not done, it is
impossible that a highly civilized people, accustomed
to reason and to doubt, should ever embrace a religion
of which the glaring absurdities set reason and doubt
at defiance. There are many instances of nations
changing their religion, but there is no instance of a
progressive country voluntarily adopting a retrogressive
religion; neither is there any example of a declining
country ameliorating its religion. It is of course true,
that a good religion is favourable to civilization, and a
bad one unfavourable to it. Unless, however, there is
some interference from without, no people will ever
discover that their religion is bad until their reason
tells them so; but if their reason is inactive, and their
knowledge stationary, the discovery will never be made.
A country that continues in its old ignorance will
always remain in its old religion. Surely nothing can
be plainer than this. A very ignorant people will, by
virtue of their ignorance, incline towards a religion
full of marvels; a religion which boasts of innumerable
gods, and which ascribes every occurrence to the immediate
authority of those gods. On the other hand, a
people whose knowledge makes them better judges of
evidence, and who are accustomed to that most difficult
task, the practice of doubting, will require a religion less
marvellous, less obtrusive; one that taxes their credulity
less heavily. But will you, therefore, say, that the
badness of the first religion causes the ignorance; and
that the goodness of the second religion causes the
knowledge? Will you say, that when one event precedes
another, the one which comes first is the effect,
and the one which follows afterwards is the cause?
This is not the way in which men reason on the ordinary
affairs of life; and it is difficult to see why they
should reason thus respecting the history of past
events.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the religious opinions which prevail
in any period are among the symptoms by which that
period is marked. When the opinions are deeply rooted,
they do, no doubt, influence the conduct of men; but
before they can be deeply rooted, some intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
change must first have taken place. We may as well
expect that the seed should quicken in the barren rock,
as that a mild and philosophic religion should be established
among ignorant and ferocious savages. Of this
innumerable experiments have been made, and always
with the same result. Men of excellent intentions, and
full of a fervent though mistaken zeal, have been, and
still are, attempting to propagate their own religion
among the inhabitants of barbarous countries. By
strenuous and unremitting activity, and frequently by
promises, and even by actual gifts, they have, in many
cases, persuaded savage communities to make a profession
of the Christian religion. But whoever will
compare the triumphant reports of the missionaries
with the long chain of evidence supplied by competent
travellers, will soon find that such profession is only
nominal, and that these ignorant tribes have adopted,
indeed, the ceremonies of the new religion, but have by
no means adopted the religion itself. They receive
the externals, but there they stop. They may baptize
their children; they may take the sacrament; they
may flock to the church. All this they may do, and
yet be as far removed from the spirit of Christianity as
when they bowed the knee before their former idols.
The rites and forms of a religion lie on the surface;
they are at once seen, they are quickly learned, easily
copied by those who are unable to penetrate to that
which lies beneath. It is this deeper and inward
change which alone is durable; and this the savage
can never experience while he is sunk in an ignorance
that levels him with the brutes by which he is surrounded.
Remove the ignorance, and then the religion
may enter. This is the only course by which ultimate
benefit can be effected. After a careful study of the
history and condition of barbarous nations, I do most
confidently assert, that there is no well attested case of
any people being permanently converted to Christianity,
except in those very few instances where missionaries,
being men of knowledge, as well as men of piety, have
familiarized the savage with habits of thought, and, by
thus stimulating his intellect, have prepared him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the reception of those religious principles, which, without
such stimulus, he could never have understood.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>It is in this way that, looking at things upon a large
scale, the religion of mankind is the effect of their improvement,
not the cause of it. But, looking at things
upon a small scale, or taking what is called a practical
view of some short and special period, circumstances
will occasionally occur which disturb this general order,
and apparently reverse the natural process. And this,
as in all such cases, can only arise from the peculiarities
of individual men; who, moved by the minor laws which
regulate individual actions, are able, by their genius or
their energy, to interfere with the operation of those
greater laws which regulate large societies. Owing to
circumstances still unknown, there appear, from time
to time, great thinkers, who, devoting their lives to a
single purpose, are able to anticipate the progress of
mankind, and to produce a religion or a philosophy, by
which important effects are eventually brought about.
But, if we look into history, we shall clearly see that,
although the origin of a new opinion may be thus due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to a single man, the result which the new opinion produces
will depend on the condition of the people
among whom it is propagated. If either a religion or
a philosophy is too much in advance of a nation, it can
do no present service, but must bide its time, until
the minds of men are ripe for its reception. Of this
innumerable instances will occur to most readers.
Every science and every creed has had its martyrs;
men exposed to obloquy, or even to death, because they
knew more than their contemporaries, and because
society was not sufficiently advanced to receive the
truths which they communicated. According to the
ordinary course of affairs, a few generations pass away,
and then there comes a period when these very truths
are looked upon as commonplace facts; and a little
later, there comes another period, in which they are
declared to be necessary, and even the dullest intellects
wonder how they could ever have been denied. This
is what happens when the human mind is allowed to
have fair play, and to exercise itself, with tolerable freedom,
in the accumulation and diffusion of knowledge.
If, however, by violent, and therefore by artificial,
means, this same society is prevented from exercising
its intellect, then the truths, however important they
may be, can never be received. For why should certain
truths be rejected in one age, and acknowledged in
another? The truths remain the same; their ultimate
recognition must, therefore, be due to a change in the
society which now accepts what it had before despised.
Indeed, history is full of evidence of the utter inefficiency
even of the noblest principles, when they are
promulgated among a very ignorant nation. Thus it
was that the doctrine of One God, taught to the
Hebrews of old, remained for many centuries altogether
inoperative. The people to whom it was addressed
had not yet emerged from barbarism; they were, therefore,
unable to raise their minds to so elevated a conception.
Like all other barbarians, they craved after a
religion which would feed their credulity with incessant
wonders; and which, instead of abstracting the
Deity to a single essence, would multiply their gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
until they covered every field, and swarmed in every
forest. This is the idolatry which is the natural fruit
of ignorance; and this it is to which the Hebrews were
perpetually recurring. Notwithstanding the most severe
and unremitting punishments, they, at every opportunity,
abandoned that pure theism which their minds
were too backward to receive, and relapsed into superstitions
which they could more easily understand,&mdash;into
the worship of the golden calf, and the adoration
of the brazen serpent. Now, and in this age of the
world, they have long ceased to do these things. And
why? Not because their religious feelings are more
easily aroused, or their religious fears more often excited.
So far from this, they are dissevered from their
old associations; they have lost for ever those scenes by
which men might well have been moved. They are no
longer influenced by those causes which inspired emotions,
sometimes of terror, sometimes of gratitude.
They no longer witness the pillar of cloud by day, or
the pillar of fire by night; they no longer see the Law
being given from Sinai, nor do they hear the thunder
rolling from Horeb. In the presence of these great
appeals, they remained idolaters in their hearts, and
whenever an opportunity occurred, they became idolaters
in their practice, and this they did because they
were in that state of barbarism, of which idolatry is the
natural product. To what possible circumstance can
their subsequent change be ascribed, except to the
simple fact, that the Hebrews, like all other people,
as they advanced in civilization, began to abstract and
refine their religion, and, despising the old worship of
many gods, thus by slow degrees elevated their minds
to that steady perception of One Great Cause, which,
at an earlier period, it had been vainly attempted to
impress upon them?</p>

<p>Thus intimate is the connexion between the opinions
of a people and their knowledge; and thus necessary
is it that, so far as nations are concerned, intellectual
activity should precede religious improvement. If we
require further illustrations of this important truth,
we shall find them in the events which occurred in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Europe soon after the promulgation of Christianity.
The Romans were, with rare exceptions, an ignorant
and barbarous race; ferocious, dissolute, and cruel.
For such a people, Polytheism was the natural creed;
and we read, accordingly, that they practised an idolatry
which a few great thinkers, and only a few, ventured
to despise. The Christian religion, falling among these
men, found them unable to appreciate its sublime and
admirable doctrines. And when, a little later, Europe
was overrun by fresh immigrations, the invaders, who
were even more barbarous than the Romans, brought
with them those superstitions which were suited to
their actual condition. It was upon the materials arising
from these two sources that Christianity was now
called to do her work. The result is most remarkable.
For after the new religion seemed to have carried all
before it, and had received the homage of the best part
of Europe, it was soon found that nothing had been
really effected. It was soon found that society was in
that early stage in which superstition is inevitable; and
in which men, if they do not have it in one form, will
have it in another. It was in vain that Christianity
taught a simple doctrine, and enjoined a simple worship.
The minds of men were too backward for so great a
step, and required more complicated forms, and a more
complicated belief. What followed is well known to
the students of ecclesiastical history. The superstition
of Europe, instead of being diminished, was only
turned into a fresh channel. The new religion was
corrupted by the old follies. The adoration of idols
was succeeded by the adoration of saints; the worship
of the Virgin was substituted for the worship of Cybele;<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
Pagan ceremonies were established in Christian
churches; not only the mummeries of idolatry, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
likewise its doctrines, were quickly added, and were
incorporated and worked into the spirit of the new
religion; until, after a lapse of a few generations,
Christianity exhibited so grotesque and hideous a form,
that its best features were lost, and the lineaments of
its earlier loveliness altogether destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>After some centuries were passed, Christianity slowly
emerged from these corruptions; many of which, however,
even the most civilized countries have not yet
been able to throw off.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> Indeed, it was found impossible
to effect even the beginning of a reform, until
the European intellect was, in some degree, roused from
its lethargy. The knowledge of men, gradually advancing,
made them indignant at superstitions which
they had formerly admired. The way in which their
indignation increased, until, in the sixteenth century,
it broke out into that great event which is well called
the Reformation, forms one of the most interesting
subjects in modern history. But, for our present purpose,
it is enough to keep in mind the memorable and
important fact that, for centuries after Christianity
was the established religion of Europe, it failed to bear
its natural fruit, because its lot was cast among a
people whose ignorance compelled them to be superstitious,
and who, on account of their superstition,
defaced a system which, in its original purity, they
were unable to receive.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, in every page of history, we meet with fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
evidence of the little effect religious doctrines can produce
upon a people, unless preceded by intellectual
culture. The influence exercised by Protestantism, as
compared with Catholicism, affords an interesting example
of this. The Catholic religion bears to the
Protestant religion exactly the same relation that the
Dark Ages bear to the sixteenth century. In the
Dark Ages, men were credulous and ignorant; they
therefore produced a religion which required great
belief and little knowledge. In the sixteenth century,
their credulity and ignorance, though still considerable,
were rapidly diminishing, and it was found necessary
to organize a religion suited to their altered circumstances:
a religion more favourable to free inquiry; a
religion less full of miracles, saints, legends, and idols;
a religion of which the ceremonies were less frequent,
and less burdensome; a religion which should discourage
penance, fasting, confession, celibacy, and those
other mortifications which had long been universal.
All this was done by the establishment of Protestantism;
a mode of worship which, being thus
suited to the age, made, as is well known, speedy progress.
If this great movement had been allowed to
proceed without interruption, it would, in the course
of a few generations, have overthrown the old superstition,
and established in its place a simpler and less
troublesome creed; the rapidity with which this was
done, being, of course, proportioned to the intellectual
activity of the different countries. But, unfortunately,
the European governments, who are always meddling
in matters with which they have no concern, thought
it their duty to protect the religious interests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
people; and making common cause with the Catholic
clergy, they, in many instances, forcibly stopped the
heresy, and thus arrested the natural development of
the age. This interference was, in nearly all cases,
well intended, and is solely to be ascribed to the ignorance
of rulers respecting the proper limits of their
functions: but the evils caused by this ignorance it
would be difficult to exaggerate. During almost a
hundred and fifty years, Europe was afflicted by religious
wars, religious massacres, and religious persecutions;
not one of which would have arisen, if the
great truth had been recognised, that the state has no
concern with the opinions of men, and no right to
interfere, even in the slightest degree, with the form
of worship which they may choose to adopt. This
principle was, however, formerly unknown, or at all
events unheeded; and it was not until the middle of
the seventeenth century that the great religious contests
were brought to a final close, and the different
countries settled down into their public creeds; which,
in the essential points, have never since been permanently
altered; no nation having, for more than two
hundred years, made war upon another on account of
its religion; and all the great Catholic countries having,
during the same period, remained Catholic, all the
great Protestant ones remained Protestant.</p>

<p>From this it has arisen, that, in several of the European
countries, the religious development has not followed
its natural order, but has been artificially forced
into an unnatural one. According to the natural order,
the most civilized countries should all be Protestants,
and the most uncivilized ones Catholics. In the average
of instances this is actually the case; so that many
persons have been led into the singular error, of ascribing
all modern enlightenment to the influence of Protestantism;
overlooking the important fact, that until
the enlightenment had begun, Protestantism was never
required. But although, in the ordinary course of affairs,
the advance of the Reformation would have been the
measure, and the symptom, of that advance of knowledge
by which it was preceded, still, in many cases, the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of the government and of the church acted as disturbing
causes, and frustrated the natural progress of
religious improvement. And, after the treaty of Westphalia
had fixed the political relations of Europe, the love
of theological strife so greatly subsided, that men no
longer thought it worth their while to raise a religious
revolution, and to risk their lives in an attempt to overturn
the creed of the state. At the same time, governments,
not being themselves particularly fond of revolutions,
have encouraged this stationary condition; and
very naturally, and, as it appears to me, very wisely, have
made no great alteration, but have left the national establishments
as they found them; that is to say, the Protestant
ones Protestant, and the Catholic ones Catholic.
Hence it is, that the national religion professed by any
country at the present moment, is no decisive criterion
of the present civilization of the country; because the
circumstances which fixed the religion occurred long
since, and the religion remains endowed and established
by the mere continuance of an impetus which was
formerly given.</p>

<p>Thus far as to the origin of the ecclesiastical
establishments of Europe. But, in their practical
consequences, we see some results which are highly
instructive. For many countries owing their national
creed, not to their own proper antecedents, but to the
authority of powerful individuals, it will be invariably
found, that in such countries the creed does not produce
the effects which might have been expected from
it, and which, according to its terms, it ought to produce.
Thus, for instance, the Catholic religion is more
superstitious, and more intolerant, than the Protestant;
but it by no means follows, that those countries which
profess the former creed, must be more superstitious,
and more intolerant, than those which profess the
latter. So far from this, the French are not only quite
as free from those odious qualities as are the most
civilized Protestants, but they are more free from them
than some Protestant nations, as the Scotch and the
Swedes. Of the highly-educated class, I am not here
speaking; but of the clergy, and of the people generally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
it must be admitted, that in Scotland there is
more bigotry, more superstition, and a more thorough
contempt for the religion of others, than there is in
France. And in Sweden, which is one of the oldest
Protestant countries in Europe,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> there is, not occasionally,
but habitually, an intolerance and a spirit of persecution,
which would be discreditable to a Catholic
country; but which is doubly disgraceful when proceeding
from a people who profess to base their religion
on the right of private judgment.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>These things show, what it would be easy to prove by
a wider induction, that when, from special, or, as they
are called, accidental causes, any people profess a religion
more advanced than themselves, it will not produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
its legitimate effect.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> The superiority of Protestantism
over Catholicism consists in its diminution of superstition
and intolerance, and in the check which it gives to ecclesiastical
power. But the experience of Europe teaches
us, that when the superior religion is fixed among an
inferior people, its superiority is no longer seen. The
Scotch and the Swedes,&mdash;and to them might be added
some of the Swiss cantons,&mdash;are less civilized than the
French, and are therefore more superstitious. This
being the case, it avails them little that they have a
religion better than the French. It avails them little
that, owing to circumstances which have long since
passed away, they, three centuries ago, adopted a creed
to which the force of habit, and the influence of tradition,
now oblige them to cling. Whoever has travelled in
Scotland with sufficient attention to observe the ideas
and opinions of the people, and whoever will look into
Scotch theology, and read the history of the Scotch
Kirk, and the proceedings of the Scotch Assemblies and
Consistories, will see how little the country has benefited
by its religion, and how wide an interval there is
between its intolerant spirit and the natural tendencies
of the Protestant Reformation. On the other hand,
whoever will subject France to a similar examination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
will see an illiberal religion accompanied by liberal
views, and a creed full of superstitions professed by a
people among whom superstition is comparatively rare.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, that the French have a religion
worse than themselves; the Scotch have a religion better
than themselves. The liberality of France is as ill suited
to Catholicism, as the bigotry of Scotland is ill suited
to Protestantism. In these, as in all similar cases, the
characteristics of the creed are overpowered by the characteristics
of the people; and the national faith is, in
the most important points, altogether inoperative, because
it does not harmonize with the civilization of the
country in which it is established. How idle, then, it
is to ascribe the civilization to the creed; and how
worse than foolish are the attempts of government to
protect a religion which, if suited to the people, will
need no protection, and, if unsuited to them, will work
no good!</p>

<p>If the reader has seized the spirit of the preceding
arguments, he will hardly require that I should analyze
with equal minuteness the second disturbing cause,
namely, Literature. It is evident, that what has already
been said respecting the religion of a people, is, in a great
measure, applicable to their literature. Literature,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
when it is in a healthy and unforced state, is simply the
form in which the knowledge of a country is registered;
the mould in which it is cast. In this, as in the other
cases we have considered, individual men may of course
take great steps, and rise to a great height above the
level of their age. But if they rise beyond a certain
point, their present usefulness is impaired; if they rise
still higher, it is destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> When the interval between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the intellectual classes and the practical classes is too
great, the former will possess no influence, the latter
will reap no benefit. This is what occurred in the ancient
world, when the distance between the ignorant idolatry
of the people and the refined systems of philosophers
was altogether impassable;<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> and this is the principal
reason why the Greeks and Romans were unable to retain
the civilization which they for a short time possessed.
Precisely the same process is at the present moment
going on in Germany, where the most valuable part of
literature forms an esoteric system, which, having nothing
in common with the nation itself, produces no
effect on the national civilization. The truth is, that
although Europe has received great benefit from its
literature, this is owing, not to what the literature has
originated, but to what it has preserved. Knowledge
must be acquired, before it can be written; and the only
use of books is, to serve as a storehouse in which the
treasures of the intellect are safely kept, and where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
may be conveniently found. Literature, in itself, is but
a trifling matter; and is merely valuable as being the
armory in which the weapons of the human mind are
laid up, and from which, when required, they can be
quickly drawn. But he would be a sorry reasoner, who,
on that account, should propose to sacrifice the end, that
he might obtain the means; who should hope to defend
the armory by giving up the weapons, and who should
destroy the treasure, in order to improve the magazine
in which the treasure is kept.</p>

<p>Yet this is what many persons are apt to do. From
literary men, in particular, we hear too much of the
necessity of protecting and rewarding literature, and we
hear too little of the necessity of that freedom and boldness,
in the absence of which the most splendid literature
is altogether worthless. Indeed, there is a general tendency,
not to exaggerate the advantages of knowledge,&mdash;for
that is impossible,&mdash;but to misunderstand what that
is in which knowledge really consists. Real knowledge,
the knowledge on which all civilization is based, solely
consists in an acquaintance with the relations which
things and ideas bear to each other and to themselves;
in other words, in an acquaintance with physical and
mental laws. If the time should ever come when all
these laws are known, the circle of human knowledge
will then be complete; and, in the interim, the value of
literature depends upon the extent to which it communicates
either a knowledge of the laws, or the materials
by which the laws may be discovered. The business of
education is to accelerate this great movement, and thus
increase the fitness and aptitude of men, by increasing
the resources which they possess. Towards this purpose,
literature, so far as it is auxiliary, is highly useful. But
to look upon an acquaintance with literature as one of
the objects of education, is to mistake the order of events,
and to make the end subservient to the means. It is
because this is done, that we often find what are called
highly educated men, the progress of whose knowledge
has been actually retarded by the activity of their education.
We often find them burdened by prejudices,
which their reading, instead of dissipating, has rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
more inveterate.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> For literature, being the depository
of the thoughts of mankind, is full, not only of wisdom,
but also of absurdities. The benefit, therefore, which is
derived from literature, will depend, not so much upon
the literature itself, as upon the skill with which it is
studied, and the judgment with which it is selected.
These are the preliminary conditions of success; and if
they are not obeyed, the number and the value of the
books in a country become a matter quite unimportant.
Even in an advanced stage of civilization, there is always
a tendency to prefer those parts of literature which
favour ancient prejudices, rather than those which oppose
them; and in cases where this tendency is very strong,
the only effect of great learning will be, to supply the
materials which may corroborate old errors, and confirm
old superstitions. In our time such instances are not
uncommon; and we frequently meet with men whose
erudition ministers to their ignorance, and who the more
they read, the less they know. There have been states
of society in which this disposition was so general, that
literature has done far more harm than good. Thus,
for example, in the whole period from the sixth to the
tenth centuries, there were not in all Europe more than
three or four men who dared to think for themselves;
and even they were obliged to veil their meaning in
obscure and mystical language. The remaining part of
society was, during these four centuries, sunk in the most
degrading ignorance. Under these circumstances, the
few who were able to read, confined their studies to
works which encouraged and strengthened their superstition,
such as the legends of the saints, and the homilies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
of the fathers. From these sources they drew those
lying and impudent fables, of which the theology of that
time is principally composed.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> These miserable stories
were widely circulated, and were valued as solid and
important truths. The more the literature was read,
the more the stories were believed; in other words, the
greater the learning, the greater the ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> And
I entertain no doubt, that if, in the seventh and eighth
centuries, which were the worst part of that period,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
all knowledge of the alphabet had for a while been lost,
so that men could no longer read the books in which
they delighted, the subsequent progress of Europe would
have been more rapid than it really was. For when the
progress began, its principal antagonist was that credulity
which the literature had fostered. It was not that
better books were wanting, but it was that the relish
for such books was extinct. There was the literature
of Greece and Rome, which the monks not only preserved,
but even occasionally looked into and copied.
But what could that avail such readers as they? So
far from recognizing the merit of the ancient writers,
they were unable to feel even the beauties of their style,
and they trembled at the boldness of their inquiries.
At the first glimpse of the light, their eyes were blinded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
They never turned the leaves of a pagan author without
standing aghast at the risk they were running; and
they were in constant fear, lest by imbibing any of his
opinions, they should involve themselves in a deadly
sin. The result was, that they willingly laid aside the
great master-pieces of antiquity; and in their place
they substituted those wretched compilations, which
corrupted their taste, increased their credulity, strengthened
their errors, and prolonged the ignorance of Europe,
by embodying each separate superstition in a
written and accessible form, thus perpetuating its influence,
and enabling it to enfeeble the understanding
even of a distant posterity.</p>

<p>It is in this way that the nature of the literature possessed
by a people is of very inferior importance, in
comparison with the disposition of the people by whom
the literature is to be read. In what are rightly termed
the Dark Ages, there was a literature in which valuable
materials were to be found; but there was no one who
knew how to use them. During a considerable period,
the Latin language was a vernacular dialect;<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> and, if
men had chosen, they might have studied the great
Latin authors. But to do this, they must have been in
a state of society very different from that in which they
actually lived. They, like every other people, measured
merit by the standard commonly received in their own
age; and, according to their standard, the dross was
better than the gold. They, therefore, rejected the
gold, and hoarded up the dross. What took place then
is, on a smaller scale, taking place now. Every literature
contains something that is true, and much that is
false; and the effect it produces will chiefly depend
upon the skill with which the truth is discriminated
from the falsehood. New ideas, and new discoveries,
possess prospectively an importance difficult to exaggerate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
but until the ideas are received, and the discoveries
adopted, they exercise no influence, and, therefore,
work no good. No literature can ever benefit a
people, unless it finds them in a state of preliminary
preparation. In this respect, the analogy with religious
opinions is complete. If the religion and the literature
of a country are unsuited to its wants, they will be useless,
because the literature will be neglected, and the
religion will be disobeyed. In such cases, even the
ablest books are unread, and the purest doctrines despised.
The works fall into oblivion; the faith is corrupted
by heresy.</p>

<p>The other opinion to which I have referred is, that
the civilization of Europe is chiefly owing to the ability
which has been displayed by the different governments,
and to the sagacity with which the evils of society have
been palliated by legislative remedies. To any one who
has studied history in its original sources, this notion
must appear so extravagant, as to make it difficult to
refute it with becoming gravity. Indeed, of all the
social theories which have ever been broached, there is
none so utterly untenable, and so unsound in all its
parts, as this. In the first place, we have the obvious
consideration, that the rulers of a country have, under
ordinary circumstances, always been the inhabitants of
that country; nurtured by its literature, bred to its
traditions, and imbibing its prejudices. Such men are,
at best, only the creatures of the age, never its creators.
Their measures are the result of social progress, not the
cause of it. This may be proved, not only by speculative
arguments, but also by a practical consideration,
which any reader of history can verify for himself. No
great political improvement, no great reform, either
legislative or executive, has ever been originated in any
country by its rulers. The first suggesters of such
steps have invariably been bold and able thinkers, who
discern the abuse, denounce it, and point out how it is
to be remedied. But long after this is done, even the
most enlightened governments continue to uphold the
abuse, and reject the remedy. At length, if circumstances
are favourable, the pressure from without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
becomes so strong, that the government is obliged to
give way; and, the reform being accomplished, the
people are expected to admire the wisdom of their
rulers, by whom all this has been done. That this
is the course of political improvement, must be well
known to whoever has studied the law-books of different
countries in connexion with the previous progress
of their knowledge. Full and decisive evidence of this
will be brought forward in the present work; but, by
way of illustration, I may refer to the abolition of the
corn-laws, undoubtedly one of the most remarkable
facts in the history of England during this century.
The propriety, and, indeed, the necessity, of their abolition,
is now admitted by every one of tolerable information;
and the question arises, as to how it was
brought about. Those Englishmen who are little
versed in the history of their country will say, that
the real cause was the wisdom of Parliament; while
others, attempting to look a little further, will ascribe
it to the activity of the Anti-Corn-Law League, and
the consequent pressure put upon Government. But
whoever will minutely trace the different stages
through which this great question successively passed,
will find, that the Government, the Legislature, and the
League, were the unwitting instruments of a power far
greater than all other powers put together. They were
simply the exponents of that march of public opinion,
which on this subject had begun nearly a century before
their time. The steps of this vast movement I shall
examine on another occasion; at present it is enough
to say, that soon after the middle of the eighteenth
century, the absurdity of protective restrictions on
trade was so fully demonstrated by the political economists,
as to be admitted by every man who understood
their arguments, and had mastered the evidence connected
with them. From this moment, the repeal of
the corn-laws became a matter, not of party, nor of
expediency, but merely of knowledge. Those who
knew the facts, opposed the laws; those who were
ignorant of the facts, favoured the laws. It was, therefore,
clear, that whenever the diffusion of knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
reached a certain point, the laws must fall. The merit
of the League was, to assist this diffusion; the merit of
the Parliament was, to yield to it. It is, however, certain,
that the members both of League and Legislature
could at best only slightly hasten what the progress of
knowledge rendered inevitable. If they had lived a
century earlier, they would have been altogether powerless,
because the age would not have been ripe for their
labours. They were the creatures of a movement which
began long before any of them were born; and the utmost
they could do was, to put into operation what
others had taught, and repeat, in louder tones, the
lessons they had learned from their masters. For, it
was not pretended, they did not even pretend themselves,
that there was anything new in the doctrines
which they preached from the hustings, and disseminated
in every part of the kingdom. The discoveries
had long since been made, and were gradually doing
their work; encroaching upon old errors, and making
proselytes in all directions. The reformers of our time
swam with the stream: they aided what it would have
been impossible long to resist. Nor is this to be deemed
a slight or grudging praise of the services they undoubtedly
rendered. The opposition they had to encounter
was still immense; and it should always be
remembered, as a proof of the backwardness of political
knowledge, and of the incompetence of political legislators,
that although the principles of free trade had
been established for nearly a century by a chain of
arguments as solid as those on which the truths of
mathematics are based, they were to the last moment
strenuously resisted; and it was only with the greatest
difficulty that Parliament was induced to grant what
the people were determined to have, and the necessity
of which had been proved by the ablest men during
three successive generations.</p>

<p>I have selected this instance as an illustration, because
the facts connected with it are undisputed, and,
indeed, are fresh in the memory of us all. For it was
not concealed at the time, and posterity ought to know,
that this great measure, which, with the exception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the Reform Bill, is by far the most important ever
passed by a British parliament, was, like the Reform
Bill, extorted from the legislature by a pressure from
without; that it was conceded, not cheerfully, but with
fear; and that it was carried by statesmen who had
spent their lives in opposing what they now suddenly
advocated. Such was the history of these events; and
such likewise has been the history of all those improvements
which are important enough to rank as epochs in
the history of modern legislation.</p>

<p>Besides this, there is another circumstance worthy
the attention of those writers who ascribe a large part
of European civilization to measures originated by
European governments. This is, that every great
reform which has been effected, has consisted, not in
doing something new, but in undoing something old.
The most valuable additions made to legislation have
been enactments destructive of preceding legislation;
and the best laws which have been passed, have been
those by which some former laws were repealed. In
the case just mentioned, of the corn-laws, all that was
done was to repeal the old laws, and leave trade to its
natural freedom. When this great reform was accomplished,
the only result was, to place things on the
same footing as if legislators had never interfered at
all. Precisely the same remark is applicable to another
leading improvement in modern legislation, namely, the
decrease of religious persecution. This is unquestionably
an immense boon; though, unfortunately, it is still
imperfect, even in the most civilized countries. But it is
evident that the concession merely consists in this:
that legislators have retraced their own steps, and undone
their own work. If we examine the policy of the
most humane and enlightened governments, we shall
find this to be the course they have pursued. The whole
scope and tendency of modern legislation is, to restore
things to that natural channel from which the ignorance
of preceding legislation has driven them. This
is one of the great works of the present age; and
if legislators do it well, they will deserve the gratitude
of mankind. But though we may thus be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
grateful to individual lawgivers, we owe no thanks to
lawgivers, considered as a class. For since the most
valuable improvements in legislation are those which
subvert preceding legislation, it is clear that the
balance of good cannot be on their side. It is clear,
that the progress of civilization cannot be due to those
who, on the most important subjects, have done so
much harm, that their successors are considered benefactors,
simply because they reverse their policy, and
thus restore affairs to the state in which they would
have remained, if politicians had allowed them to run
on in the course which the wants of society required.</p>

<p>Indeed, the extent to which the governing classes
have interfered, and the mischiefs which that interference
has produced, are so remarkable, as to make
thoughtful men wonder how civilization could advance,
in the face of such repeated obstacles. In some of the
European countries, the obstacles have, in fact, proved
insuperable, and the national progress is thereby
stopped. Even in England, where, from causes which
I shall presently relate, the higher ranks have for some
centuries been less powerful than elsewhere, there has
been inflicted an amount of evil, which, though much
smaller than that incurred in other countries, is sufficiently
serious to form a melancholy chapter in the
history of the human mind. To sum up these evils
would be to write a history of English legislation; for
it may be broadly stated, that, with the exception of
certain necessary enactments respecting the preservation
of order, and the punishment of crime, nearly
everything which has been done, has been done amiss.
Thus, to take only such conspicuous facts as do not
admit of controversy, it is certain that all the most
important interests have been grievously damaged by
the attempts of legislators to aid them. Among the
accessories of modern civilization, there is none of
greater moment than trade, the spread of which has
probably done more than any other single agent to
increase the comfort and happiness of man. But every
European government which has legislated respecting
trade, has acted as if its main object were to suppress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the trade, and ruin the traders. Instead of leaving the
national industry to take its own course, it has been
troubled by an interminable series of regulations, all
intended for its good, and all inflicting serious harm.
To such a height has this been carried, that the commercial
reforms which have distinguished England
during the last twenty years, have solely consisted in
undoing this mischievous and intrusive legislation.
The laws formerly enacted on this subject, and too
many of which are still in force, are marvellous to contemplate.
It is no exaggeration to say, that the history
of the commercial legislation of Europe presents every
possible contrivance for hampering the energies of
commerce. Indeed, a very high authority, who has
maturely studied this subject, has recently declared,
that if it had not been for smuggling, trade could not
have been conducted, but must have perished, in consequence
of this incessant interference.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> However
paradoxical this assertion may appear, it will be denied
by no one who knows how feeble trade once was, and
how strong the obstacles were which opposed it. In
every quarter, and at every moment, the hand of
government was felt. Duties on importation, and
duties on exportation; bounties to raise up a losing
trade, and taxes to pull down a remunerative one; this
branch of industry forbidden, and that branch of industry
encouraged; one article of commerce must not
be grown, because it was grown in the colonies; another
article might be grown and bought, but not sold
again, while a third article might be bought and sold,
but not leave the country. Then, too, we find laws to
regulate wages; laws to regulate prices; laws to regulate
profits; laws to regulate the interest of money;
custom-house arrangements of the most vexatious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
kind, aided by a complicated scheme, which was well
called the sliding-scale,&mdash;a scheme of such perverse
ingenuity, that the duties constantly varied on the
same article, and no man could calculate beforehand
what he would have to pay. To this uncertainty, itself
the bane of all commerce, there was added a severity of
exaction, felt by every class of consumers and producers.
The tolls were so onerous, as to double and often quadruple
the cost of production. A system was organized,
and strictly enforced, of interference with markets,
interference with manufactories, interference with
machinery, interference even with shops. The towns
were guarded by excisemen, and the ports swarmed
with tide-waiters, whose sole business was to inspect
nearly every process of domestic industry, peer into
every package, and tax every article; while, that absurdity
might be carried to its extreme height, a large
part of all this was by way of protection: that is to
say, the money was avowedly raised, and the inconvenience
suffered, not for the use of the government,
but for the benefit of the people; in other words, the
industrious classes were robbed, in order that industry
might thrive.</p>

<p>Such are some of the benefits which European trade
owes to the paternal care of European legislators. But
worse still remains behind. For the economical evils,
great as they were, have been far surpassed by the
moral evils which this system produced. The first
inevitable consequence was, that, in every part of
Europe, there arose numerous and powerful gangs of
armed smugglers, who lived by disobeying the laws
which their ignorant rulers had imposed. These men,
desperate from the fear of punishment,<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> and accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to the commission of every crime, contaminated
the surrounding population; introduced into peaceful
villages vices formerly unknown; caused the ruin of
entire families; spread, wherever they came, drunkenness,
theft, and dissoluteness; and familiarized their
associates with those coarse and swinish debaucheries
which were the natural habits of so vagrant and lawless
a life.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> The innumerable crimes arising from this,<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
are directly chargeable upon the European governments
by whom they were provoked. The offences were
caused by the laws; and now that the laws are repealed,
the offences have disappeared. But it will
hardly be pretended, that the interests of civilization
have been advanced by such a policy as this. It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
hardly be pretended, that we owe much to a system
which, having called into existence a new class of
criminals, at length retraces its steps; and, though it
thus puts an end to the crime, only destroys what its
own acts had created.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say, that these remarks do not
affect the real services rendered to society by every
tolerably organized government. In all countries, a
power of punishing crime, and of framing laws, must
reside somewhere; otherwise the nation is in a state of
anarchy. But the accusation which the historian is
bound to bring against every government which has
hitherto existed is, that it has overstepped its proper
functions, and, at each step, has done incalculable
harm. The love of exercising power has been found to
be so universal, that no class of men who have possessed
authority have been able to avoid abusing it.
To maintain order, to prevent the strong from oppressing
the weak, and to adopt certain precautions respecting
the public health, are the only services which any
government can render to the interests of civilization.
That these are services of immense value, no one will
deny; but it cannot be said, that by them civilization
is advanced, or the progress of Man accelerated. All
that is done is, to afford the opportunity of progress;
the progress itself must depend upon other matters.
And that this is the sound view of legislation, is,
moreover, evident from the fact, that as knowledge is
becoming more diffused, and as an increasing experience
is enabling each successive generation better to understand
the complicated relations of life; just in the
same proportion are men insisting upon the repeal of
those protective laws, the enactment of which was
deemed by politicians to be the greatest triumph of
political foresight.</p>

<p>Seeing, therefore, that the efforts of government in
favour of civilization are, when most successful, altogether
negative; and seeing too, that when those efforts
are more than negative, they become injurious,&mdash;it
clearly follows, that all speculations must be erroneous
which ascribe the progress of Europe to the wisdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
its rulers. This is an inference which rests not only
on the arguments already adduced, but on facts which
might be multiplied from every page of history. For
no government having recognized its proper limits, the
result is, that every government has inflicted on its
subjects great injuries; and has done this nearly always
with the best intentions. The effects of its protective
policy in injuring trade, and, what is far worse, in
increasing crime, have just been noticed; and to these
instances, innumerable others might be added. Thus,
during many centuries, every government thought it
was its bounden duty to encourage religious truth, and
discourage religious error. The mischief this has produced
is incalculable. Putting aside all other considerations,
it is enough to mention its two leading
consequences; which are, the increase of hypocrisy,
and the increase of perjury. The increase of hypocrisy
is the inevitable result of connecting any description
of penalty with the profession of particular opinions.
Whatever may be the case with individuals, it is certain
that the majority of men find an extreme difficulty in
long resisting constant temptation. And when the
temptation comes to them in the shape of honour and
emolument, they are too often ready to profess the
dominant opinions, and abandon, not indeed their belief,
but the external marks by which that belief is
made public. Every man who takes this step is a
hypocrite; and every government which encourages
this step to be taken, is an abettor of hypocrisy and a
creator of hypocrites. Well, therefore, may we say,
that when a government holds out as a bait, that those
who profess certain opinions shall enjoy certain privileges,
it plays the part of the tempter of old, and, like
the Evil One, basely offers the good things of this
world to him who will change his worship and deny
his faith. At the same time, and as a part of this
system, the increase of perjury has accompanied the
increase of hypocrisy. For legislators, plainly seeing
that proselytes thus obtained could not be relied upon,
have met the danger by the most extraordinary precautions;
and compelling men to confirm their belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
by repeated oaths, have thus sought to protect the old
creed against the new converts. It is this suspicion as
to the motives of others, which has given rise to oaths
of every kind and in every direction. In England,
even the boy at college is forced to swear about matters
which he cannot understand, and which far riper minds
are unable to master. If he afterwards goes into Parliament,
he must again swear about his religion; and
at nearly every stage of political life he must take fresh
oaths; the solemnity of which is often strangely contrasted
with the trivial functions to which they are the
prelude. A solemn adjuration of the Deity being thus
made at every turn, it has happened, as might have
been expected, that oaths, enjoined as a matter of
course, have at length degenerated into a matter of
form. What is lightly taken, is easily broken. And
the best observers of English society,&mdash;observers too
whose characters are very different, and who hold the
most opposite opinions,&mdash;are all agreed on this, that the
perjury habitually practised in England, and of which
government is the immediate creator, is so general,
that it has become a source of national corruption,
has diminished the value of human testimony, and
shaken the confidence which men naturally place in the
word of their fellow-creatures.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>The open vices, and, what is much more dangerous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the hidden corruption, thus generated in the midst of
society by the ignorant interference of Christian rulers,
is indeed a painful subject; but it is one which I could
not omit in an analysis of the causes of civilization. It
would be easy to push the inquiry still further, and to
show how legislators, in every attempt they have made
to protect some particular interests, and uphold some
particular principles, have not only failed, but have
brought about results diametrically opposite to those
which they proposed. We have seen that their laws
in favour of industry have injured industry; that their
laws in favour of religion have increased hypocrisy;
and that their laws to secure truth have encouraged
perjury. Exactly in the same way, nearly every country
has taken steps to prevent usury, and keep down the
interest of money; and the invariable effect has been to
increase usury, and raise the interest of money. For,
since no prohibition, however stringent, can destroy
the natural relation between demand and supply, it has
followed, that when some men want to borrow, and
other men want to lend, both parties are sure to find
means of evading a law which interferes with their
mutual rights.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> If the two parties were left to adjust
their own bargain undisturbed, the usury would depend
on the circumstances of the loan; such as the amount
of security, and the chance of repayment. But this
natural arrangement has been complicated by the interference
of government.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> A certain risk being always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
incurred by those who disobey the law, the usurer,
very properly, refuses to lend his money unless he is
also compensated for the danger he is in from the
penalty hanging over him. This compensation can
only be made by the borrower, who is thus obliged to
pay what in reality is a double interest: one interest
for the natural risk on the loan, and another interest
for the extra risk from the law. Such, then, is the
position in which every European legislature has placed
itself. By enactments against usury, it has increased
what it wished to destroy; it has passed laws, which
the imperative necessities of men compel them to violate:
while, to wind up the whole, the penalty for such violation
falls on the borrowers; that is, on the very class
in whose favour the legislators interfered.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>In the same meddling spirit, and with the same mistaken
notions of protection, the great Christian governments
have done other things still more injurious. They
have made strenuous and repeated efforts to destroy the
liberty of the press, and prevent men from expressing
their sentiments on the most important questions in
politics and religion. In nearly every country, they,
with the aid of the church, have organized a vast system
of literary police; the sole object of which is, to abrogate
the undoubted right of every citizen to lay his
opinions before his fellow-citizens. In the very few
countries where they have stopped short of these extreme
steps, they have had recourse to others less
violent, but equally unwarrantable. For even where
they have not openly forbidden the free dissemination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of knowledge, they have done all that they could to check
it. On all the implements of knowledge, and on all the
means by which it is diffused, such as paper, books,
political journals, and the like, they have imposed duties
so heavy, that they could hardly have done worse if
they had been the sworn advocates of popular ignorance.
Indeed, looking at what they have actually
accomplished, it may be emphatically said, that they
have taxed the human mind. They have made the
very thoughts of men pay toll. Whoever wishes to
communicate his ideas to others, and thus do what he
can to increase the stock of our acquirements, must first
pour his contributions into the imperial exchequer.
That is the penalty inflicted on him for instructing his
fellow-creatures. That is the blackmail which government
extorts from literature; and on receipt of which
it accords its favour, and agrees to abstain from further
demands. And what causes all this to be the more insufferable,
is the use which is made of these and similar
exactions, wrung from every kind of industry, both
bodily and mental. It is truly a frightful consideration,
that knowledge is to be hindered, and that the proceeds
of honest labour, of patient thought, and sometimes of
profound genius, are to be diminished, in order that a
large part of their scanty earnings may go to swell the
pomp of an idle and ignorant court, minister to the
caprice of a few powerful individuals, and too often
supply them with the means of turning against the
people resources which the people called into existence.</p>

<p>These, and the foregoing statements, respecting the
effects produced on European society by political legislation,
are not doubtful or hypothetical inferences, but
are such as every reader of history may verify for himself.
Indeed, some of them are still acting in England;
and, in one country or another, the whole of them may
be seen in full force. When put together, they compose
an aggregate so formidable, that we may well wonder
how, in the face of them, civilization has been able to
advance. That, under such circumstances, it has advanced,
is a decisive proof of the extraordinary energy of
Man; and justifies a confident belief, that as the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of legislation is diminished, and the human mind less
hampered, the progress will continue with accelerated
speed. But it is absurd, it would be a mockery of all
sound reasoning, to ascribe to legislation any share in
the progress; or to expect any benefit from future legislators,
except that sort of benefit which consists in undoing
the work of their predecessors. This is what the
present generation claims at their hands; and it should
be remembered that what one generation solicits as a
boon, the next generation demands as a right. And,
when the right is pertinaciously refused, one of two
things has always happened: either the nation has retrogaded,
or else the people have risen. Should the
government remain firm, this is the cruel dilemma in
which men are placed. If they submit, they injure
their country; if they rebel, they may injure it still
more. In the ancient monarchies of the East, their
usual plan was to yield; in the monarchies of Europe,
it has been to resist. Hence those insurrections and
rebellions which occupy so large a space in modern
history, and which are but repetitions of the old story,
the undying struggle between oppressors and oppressed.
It would, however, be unjust to deny, that in one
country the fatal crisis has now for several generations
been successfully averted. In one European country,
and in one alone, the people have been so strong and
the government so weak, that the history of legislation,
taken as a whole, is, notwithstanding a few aberrations,
the history of slow, but constant concession: reforms
which would have been refused to argument, have been
yielded from fear; while from the steady increase of
democratic opinions, protection after protection, and
privilege after privilege, have, even in our time, been
torn away; until the old institutions, though they
retain their former name, have lost their former vigour,
and there no longer remains a doubt as to what their
fate must ultimately be. Nor need we add, that in this
same country, where, more than in any other of Europe,
legislators are the exponents and the servants of the
popular will, the progress has, on this account, been
more undeviating than elsewhere; there has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
neither anarchy nor revolution; and the world has been
made familiar with the great truth, that one main condition
of the prosperity of a people is, that its rulers shall
have very little power, that they shall exercise that
power very sparingly, and that they shall by no means
presume to raise themselves into supreme judges of the
national interests, or deem themselves authorized to
defeat the wishes of those for whose benefit alone they
occupy the post entrusted to them.</p>

influenced by the French mind, was Dryden; but this is chiefly apparent
in his plays, the whole of which are now deservedly forgotten. His great
works, and, above all, those wonderful satires, in which he distances
every competitor, except Juvenal, are thoroughly national, and, as mere
specimens of English, are, if I may express my own judgment, to be
ranked immediately after Shakspeare. In Dryden's writings there are
unquestionably many Gallicisms of expression, but few Gallicisms of
thought; and it is by these last that we must estimate the real amount
of foreign influence. Sir Walter Scott goes so far as to say, &lsquo;It will
admit of question, whether any single French word has been naturalized
upon the sole authority of Dryden.&rsquo; <i>Scott's Life of Dryden</i>, p. 523,

and therefore increased the value, of our literature, is, that in no

protect literature is to injure it, are propositions for the proof of
which I must refer to chap. xi. of this volume&mdash;on the system of Louis
XIV. In the mean time, I will quote the following words from a learned
and, what is much better, a thoughtful writer: &lsquo;Nor must he who will
understand the English institutions leave out of view the character of
the enduring works which had sprung from the salient energy of the
English mind. Literature had been left to develop itself. William of
Orange was foreign to it; Anne cared not for it; the first George knew

between the French and German intellects will be traced in the next

of their own writers: &lsquo;Denn einestheils war zu diesen Gegenständen immer

übersetzt wurden, und durch die Vorliebe des Königs von Preussen
Friedrichs II., der von Franzosen gebildet worden war, französische
Gelehrte besonders geehrt und angestellt wurden, entstand ein Wetteifer
der Deutschen, auch in dem schriftlichen Vortrage nicht zurück zu

established in Germany will be found in <i>Kay's Social Condition and
Education of the People of Europe</i>, vol. ii. pp. 1&ndash;344. But Mr. Kay,
like most literary men, overrates the advantages of literary
acquirements, and underrates that education of the faculties which
neither books nor schools can impart to a people who are debarred from
the exercise of civil and political rights. In the history of the
protective spirit (chaps. ix. and x. of the present volume), I shall
return to this subject, in connexion with France; and in the next volume
I shall examine it in regard to German civilization. In the mean time, I
must be allowed to protest against the account Mr. Kay has given of the
results of compulsory education; an agreeable picture, drawn by an
amiable and intelligent writer, but of the inaccuracy of which I possess
decisive evidence. Two points only I will now refer to: 1st. The
notorious fact, that the German people, notwithstanding their so-called
education, are unfit to take any share in political matters, and have no
aptitude for the practical and administrative parts of government. 2nd.
The fact, equally notorious to those who have studied the subject, that
there are more popular superstitions in Prussia, the most educated part
of Germany, than there are in England; and that the tenacity with which
men cling to them is greater in Prussia than in England. For
illustration of the practical working, in individual cases, of
compulsory education, and of the hardship it causes, see a scandalous
occurrence, related in <i>Laing's Notes of a Traveller</i>, 8vo. 1842, p.
165, first series; and on the physical evils produced by German
education, see <i>Phillips on Scrofula</i>, London, 1846, pp. 253, 254, where
there is some useful evidence of the consequences of &lsquo;that great German
sin of over-regulation.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_380_380" id="Footnote_380_380"></a><a href="#FNanchor_380_380"><span class="label">[380]</span></a> This is well stated by Mr. Laing, by far the ablest
traveller who has published observations on European society: &lsquo;German
authors, both the philosophic and the poetic, address themselves to a
public far more intellectual, and more highly cultivated, than our
reading public&hellip;. In our literature, the most obscure and abstruse of
metaphysical or philosophical writers <i>take the public mind in a far
lower state</i>, simply cognisant of the meaning of language, and possessed
of the ordinary reasoning powers&hellip;. The social influence of German
literature is, consequently, confined within a narrower circle. It has
no influence on the mind of the lower, or even of the middle classes in
active life, who have not the opportunity or leisure to screw their
faculties up to the pitch-note of their great writers. The reading
public must devote much time to acquire the knowledge, tone of feeling,
and of imagination, necessary to follow the writing public. The social
economist finds accordingly in Germany the most extraordinary dulness,
inertness of mind, and ignorance, below a certain level, with the most
extraordinary intellectual development, learning, and genius, at or
above it.&rsquo; <i>Laing's Notes of a Traveller</i>, first series, pp. 266, 267.
The same acute observer says, in a later work (<i>Notes</i>, third series,
8vo. 1852, p. 12): &lsquo;The two classes speak and think in different
languages. The cultivated German language, the language of German
literature, is not the language of the common man, nor even of the man
far up in the middle ranks of society,&mdash;the farmer, tradesman,
shopkeeper.&rsquo; See also pp. 351, 352, 354. It is singular that so clear
and vigorous a thinker as Mr. Laing evidently is, should have failed in
detecting the cause of this peculiar phenomenon.</p></div>

the next volume; but it is interesting to notice, that, as early as
1775, Burke was struck by the partiality of the Americans for works on
law. See <i>Burke's Speech</i>, in <i>Parliamentary History</i>, vol. xviii. p.
495; or in <i>Burke's Works</i>, vol. i. p. 188. He says: &lsquo;In no country
perhaps in the world is the law so general a study. The profession
itself is numerous and powerful; and in most provinces it takes the
lead. The greater number of the deputies sent to the Congress were
lawyers. But all who read&mdash;and most do read&mdash;endeavour to obtain some
smattering in that science. I have been told by an eminent bookseller,
that in no branch of his business, after tracts of popular devotion,
were so many books as those on the law exported to the plantations. The
colonists have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own
use. I hear that they have sold nearly as many of Blackstone's
Commentaries in America as in England.&rsquo; Of this state of society, the
great works of Kent and Story were, at a later period, the natural
result. On the respect at present felt for the legal profession, see
<i>Lyell's Second Visit to the United States</i>, 1849, vol. i. p. 45; and as
to the judges, <i>Combe's N. America</i>, vol. ii. p. 329.</p></div>

greatest possible respect for Mr. Mill's profound work on Logic, I must
venture to think that he has ascribed too much to the influence of Bacon
in encouraging the inductive spirit, and too little to those other
circumstances which gave rise to the Baconian philosophy, and to which
that philosophy owes its success.</p></div>

lecture, he drew up &lsquo;a translation of the three first books of
L'Hospital's Conic Sections, in which geometrical demonstrations are
substituted for the algebraical of the original, according to Mr.

and modern schemes, there are some ingenious, though perhaps scarcely
tenable, remarks in Dugald Stewart's <i>Philosophy of the Mind</i>, vol. ii.

Edinburgh, was the father of Dugald. See, respecting him and his crusade
against the modern analysis, <i>Bower's History of the University of

analysis, was that it was &lsquo;more elegant&rsquo; than the comparatively modern
practice of introducing algebraic calculations into geometry. See
<i>Trail's Simson</i>, 1812, 4to. pp. 27, 67; a valuable work, which Lord
Brougham, in his hasty life of Simson, calls, &lsquo;a very learned and
exceedingly ill-written, indeed hardly readable&rsquo; book. <i>Brougham's Men
of Letters and Science</i>, vol. i. p. 482, 8vo. 1845. Dr. Trail's style is
clearer, and his sentences are less involved, than Lord Brougham's; and
he had moreover the great advantage of understanding the subject upon
which he wrote.</p></div>

origin of language (in <i>Nichols's Literary Illustrations of the

scale, the same treatment, as distinguished from a generalization of the
facts which are supplied by a comprehensive comparison of different
languages. Dr. Arnold speaks slightingly of such investigations. He
says, &lsquo;Attempts to explain the phenomena of language <i>a priori</i> seem to
me unwise.&rsquo; <i>Arnold's Miscellaneous Works</i>, p. 385. This would lead into
a discussion too long for a note, but it appears to me that those <i>a

inductive natural philosopher; and if this be the case, they are
extremely important, because no really fruitful experiment ever can be
made unless it is preceded by a judicious hypothesis. In the absence of
such an hypothesis, men may grope in the dark for centuries,
accumulating facts without obtaining knowledge.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_390_390" id="Footnote_390_390"></a><a href="#FNanchor_390_390"><span class="label">[390]</span></a> The two writers who have inquired most carefully into the
method which political economists ought to follow, are Mr. John Mill
(<i>Essays on Unsettled Questions of Political Economy</i>, 1844, pp.
120&ndash;164) and Mr. Rae (<i>New Principles of Political Economy</i>, 1834, pp.
328&ndash;351). Mr. Rae, in his ingenious work, objects to Adam Smith that he
transgressed the rules of the Baconian philosophy, and thus prevented
his inferences from being as valuable as they would have been if he had
treated his subject inductively. But Mr. Mill, with great force of
reasoning, has proved that the deductive plan is the only one by which
political economy can be raised to a science. He says, p. 143, political
economy is &lsquo;essentially an <i>abstract</i> science, and its method is the
method <i>a priori</i>;&rsquo; and at p. 146, that the <i>a posteriori</i> method is
&lsquo;altogether inefficacious.&rsquo; To this I may add, that the modern theory of
rent, which is now the corner-stone of political economy, was got at,
not by generalizing economical facts, but by reasoning downwards after
the manner of geometricians. Indeed, those who oppose the theory of
rent, always do so on the ground that it is contradicted by facts; and
then, with complete ignorance of the philosophy of method, they infer
that therefore the theory is wrong. See, for instance, <i>Jones on the
Distribution of Wealth</i>, 8vo. 1831: a book containing some interesting
facts, but vitiated by this capital defect of method. See also <i>Journal
of Statistical Society</i>, vol. i. p. 317, vol. vi. p. 322; where it is
said that economical theories should be generalized from statistical
facts. Compare vol. xvii. p. 116, vol. xviii. p. 101.</p></div>

sagacity with which Hume employed this method. See <i>Burton's Life and
Correspondence of Hume</i>, vol. ii. p. 486; where we find, that
immediately Hume had read the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, he detected Smith's
error concerning rent being an element of price: so that it now appears
that Hume was the first to make this great discovery, as far as the idea
is concerned; though Ricardo has the merit of proving it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_392_392" id="Footnote_392_392"></a><a href="#FNanchor_392_392"><span class="label">[392]</span></a> The historical facts he introduces are merely
illustrations; as any one will see who will read <i>The Natural History of
Religion</i>, in <i>Hume's Philos. Works</i>, Edinb. 1826, vol. iv. pp. 435&ndash;513.
I may mention, that there is a considerable similarity between the views
advocated in this remarkable essay and the religious stages of <i>Comte's
Philosophie Positive</i>; for Hume's early form of polytheism is evidently
the same as M. Comte's fetichism, from which both these writers believe
that monotheism subsequently arose, as a later and more refined
abstraction. That this was the course adopted by the human mind is
highly probable, and is confirmed by the learned researches of Mr.
Grote. See his <i>History of Greece</i>, vol. i. pp. 462, 497, vol. v. p. 22.
The opposite and more popular opinion, of monotheism preceding idolatry,
was held by most of the great earlier writers, and is defended by many
moderns, and among others by Dr. Whewell (<i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>, p.
256), who expresses himself with considerable confidence: see also
<i>Letters from Warburton to Hurd</i>, p. 239. Compare <i>Thirlwall's History
of Greece</i>, vol. i. p. 183, Lond. 1835, with the &lsquo;einige Funken des
Monotheismus&rsquo; of Kant, <i>Kritik der reinen Vernunft</i>, in <i>Kant's Werke</i>,

illustrative of certain general principles, which he believed could be
proved without the facts; so that, as M. Schlosser (<i>History of the
Eighteenth Century</i>, vol. ii. p. 76) well says, &lsquo;History with Hume was
only a subordinate pursuit, only a means by which he might introduce his
philosophy,&rsquo; &amp;c. Considering how little is known of the principles which
govern social and political changes, there can be no doubt that Hume was
premature in the application of this method; but it is absurd to call
the method dishonest, since the object of his History was, not to
<i>prove</i> conclusions, but to <i>illustrate</i> them: and he therefore thought
himself justified in selecting the illustrations. I am simply stating
his views, without at all defending them; indeed, I believe that in this
respect he was seriously in the wrong.</p></div>

which are worth attending to: &lsquo;Ce fut alors que les Jésuites pénétrèrent
dans la Chine pour y prêcher l'évangile. Ils ne tardèrent pas à
s'apercevoir qu'un des moyens les plus efficaces pour s'y maintenir, en
attendant le moment que le ciel avoit marqué pour éclairer ce vaste
empire, étoit d'étaler des connoissances astronomiques.&rsquo; <i>Montucla</i>,
<i>Histoire des Mathématiques</i>, vol. i. p. 468; and see vol. ii. pp. 586,
587. Cuvier delicately hints at the same conclusion. He says of Emery:
&lsquo;Il se souvenait que l'époque où le christianisme a fait le plus de
conquêtes, et où ses ministres ont obtenu le plus de respect, est celle
où ils portaient chez les peuples convertis les lumières des lettres, en
même temps que les vérités de la religion, et où ils formaient à la fois
dans les nations l'ordre le plus éminent et le plus éclairé.&rsquo; <i>Cuvier</i>,
<i>Eloges Historiques</i>, vol. iii. p. 170. Even Southey (<i>History of
Brazil</i>, vol. ii. p. 378) says: &lsquo;Missionaries have always complained of
the fickleness of their converts; and they must always complain of it,
till they discover that some degree of civilization must precede
conversion, or at least accompany it.&rsquo; And see to the same effect,

<i>Combe's North America</i>, vol. i. p. 250, vol. ii. p. 353.</p></div>

state-church, as strongly as in Spain or Portugal in the hands of a

century, it was ordered by the Swedish Church, and the order was
confirmed by government, that &lsquo;if any Swedish subject change his

Abyssinians, who have professed Christianity for centuries; but, as no
pains were taken to cultivate their intellect, they found the religion
too pure for them: they, therefore, corrupted it, and, down to the
present moment, they have not made the slightest progress. The accounts
given by Bruce of them are well known; and a traveller, who visited them
in 1839, says: &lsquo;Nothing can be more corrupt than the nominal
Christianity of this unhappy nation. It is mixed up with Judaism,
Mahommedanism, and idolatry, and is a mass of rites and superstitions

is given of the state of things in England and France so late as the

smugglers on the opposite shore were engaged, with much more labour,
risk, and expense, in introducing English woollens, by a vast system of
fraud and lying, into the towns, past a series of custom-houses. In both
countries, there was an utter dissoluteness of morals connected with
these transactions. Cheating and lying were essential to the whole
system; drunkenness accompanied it; contempt for all law grew up under
it; honest industry perished beneath it; and it was crowned with
murder.&rsquo; <i>Martineau's History of England during Thirty Years' Peace</i>,

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">ORIGIN OF HISTORY, AND STATE OF HISTORICAL LITERATURE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES.</div>

<p>I have now laid before the reader an examination of
those conspicuous circumstances to which the progress
of civilization is commonly ascribed; and I have proved
that such circumstances, so far from being the cause
of civilization, are at best only its effects; and that
although religion, literature, and legislation do, undoubtedly,
modify the condition of mankind, they are
still more modified by it. Indeed, as we have clearly
seen, they, even in their most favourable position, can
be but secondary agents; because, however beneficial
their apparent influence may be, they are themselves
the product of preceding changes, and their results will
vary according to the variations of the society on which
they work.</p>

<p>It is thus that, by each successive analysis, the field
of the present inquiry has been narrowed, until we have
found reason to believe that the growth of European
civilization is solely due to the progress of knowledge,
and that the progress of knowledge depends on the
number of truths which the human intellect discovers,
and on the extent to which they are diffused. In support
of this proposition, I have, as yet, only brought forward
such general arguments as establish a very strong
probability; which, to raise to a certainty, will require
an appeal to history in the widest sense of the term.
Thus to verify speculative conclusions by an exhaustive
enumeration of the most important particular facts, is
the task which I purpose to execute so far as my
powers will allow; and in the preceding chapter I have
briefly stated the method according to which the investigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
will be conducted. Besides this, it has
appeared to me that the principles which I have laid
down may also be tested by a mode of proceeding
which I have not yet mentioned, but which is intimately
connected with the subject now before us. This
is, to incorporate with an inquiry into the progress of
the history of Man, another inquiry into the progress of
History itself. By this means, great light will be
thrown on the movements of society; since there must
always be a connexion between the way in which men
contemplate the past, and the way in which they contemplate
the present; both views being in fact different
forms of the same habits of thought, and therefore
presenting, in each age, a certain sympathy and
correspondence with each other. It will, moreover, be
found, that such an inquiry into what I call the history
of history, will establish two leading facts of considerable
value. The first fact is, that during the last three
centuries, historians, taken as a class, have shown a
constantly increasing respect for the human intellect,
and an aversion for those innumerable contrivances by
which it was formerly shackled. The second fact is,
that during the same period, they have displayed a
growing tendency to neglect matters once deemed of
paramount importance, and have been more willing to
attend to subjects connected with the condition of the
people and the diffusion of knowledge. These two facts
will be decisively established in the present Introduction;
and it must be admitted, that their existence corroborates
the principles which I have propounded. If
it can be ascertained, that as society has improved, historical
literature has constantly tended in one given
direction, there arises a very strong probability in favour
of the truth of those views towards which it is manifestly
approaching. Indeed, it is a probability of this
sort which makes it so important for the student of any
particular science to be acquainted with its history;
because there is always a fair presumption that when
general knowledge is advancing, any single department
of it, if studied by competent men, is also advancing,
even when the results may have been so small as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
seem unworthy of attention. Hence it becomes highly
important to observe the way in which, during successive
ages, historians have shifted their ground; since
we shall find that such changes have in the long-run
always pointed to the same quarter, and are, in reality,
only part of that vast movement by which the human
intellect, with infinite difficulty, has vindicated its own
rights, and slowly emancipated itself from those inveterate
prejudices which long impeded its action.</p>

<p>With a view to these considerations, it seems advisable
that, when examining the different civilizations
into which the great countries of Europe have diverged,
I should also give an account of the way in which history
has been commonly written in each country. In
the employment of this resource, I shall be mainly
guided by a desire to illustrate the intimate connexion
between the actual condition of a people and their
opinions respecting the past; and, in order to keep this
connexion in sight, I shall treat the state of historical
literature, not as a separate subject, but as forming part
of the intellectual history of each nation. The present
volume will contain a view of the principal characteristics
of French civilization until the great Revolution;
and with that there will be incorporated an
account of the French historians, and of the remarkable
improvements they introduced into their own departments
of knowledge. The relation which these improvements
bore to the state of society from which they
proceeded, is very striking, and will be examined at
some length; while, in the next volume, the civilization
and the historical literature of the other leading
countries will be treated in a similar manner. Before,
however, entering into these different subjects, it has
occurred to me, that a preliminary inquiry into the
origin of European history would be interesting, as
supplying information respecting matters which are
little known, and also as enabling the reader to understand
the extreme difficulty with which history has
reached its present advanced, but still very imperfect,
state. The materials for studying the earliest condition
of Europe have long since perished; but the extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
information we now possess concerning barbarous nations
will supply us with a useful resource, because
they have all much in common; the opinions of extreme
ignorance being, indeed, every where the same, except
when modified by the differences which nature presents
in various countries. I have, therefore, no hesitation
in employing the evidence which has been collected
by competent travellers, and drawing inferences
from it respecting that period of the European mind,
of which we have no direct knowledge. Such conclusions
will, of course, be speculative; but, during the
last thousand years, we are quite independent of them,
inasmuch as every great country has had chroniclers of
its own since the ninth century, while the French
have an uninterrupted series since the sixth century.
In the present chapter, I intend to give specimens of
the way in which, until the sixteenth century, history
was habitually written by the highest European authorities.
Its subsequent improvement during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, will be related under
the separate heads of the countries where the progress
was made; and as history, previous to the improvement,
was little else than a tissue of the grossest
errors, I will, in the first place, examine the leading
causes of its universal corruption, and indicate the
steps by which it was so disfigured that, during several
centuries, Europe did not possess a single man who had
critically studied the past, or who was even able to
record with tolerable accuracy the events of his own
time.</p>

<p>At a very early period in the progress of a people,
and long before they are acquainted with the use of
letters, they feel the want of some resource, which in
peace may amuse their leisure, and in war may stimulate
their courage. This is supplied to them by the
invention of ballads; which form the groundwork of
all historical knowledge, and which, in one shape or
another, are found among some of the rudest tribes of
the earth. They are, for the most part, sung by a class
of men whose particular business it is thus to preserve
the stock of traditions. Indeed, so natural is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
curiosity as to past events, that there are few nations
to whom these bards or minstrels are unknown. Thus,
to select a few instances, it is they who have preserved
the popular traditions, not only of Europe,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> but
also of China, Tibet, and Tartary;<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> likewise of India,<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> of
Scinde,<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> of Belochistan,<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> of Western Asia,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> of the islands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of the Black Sea,<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> of Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> of Western Africa,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> of North
America,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> of South America,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> and of the islands in the
Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>In all these countries, letters were long unknown; and,
as a people in that state have no means of perpetuating
their history except by oral tradition, they select the
form best calculated to assist their memory; and it will,
I believe, be found that the first rudiments of knowledge
consist always of poetry, and often of rhyme.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The
jingle pleases the ear of the barbarian, and affords a
security that he will hand it down to his children in
the unimpaired state in which he received it.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
guarantee against error increases still further the value of
these ballads; and instead of being considered as a mere
amusement, they rise to the dignity of judicial authorities.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
The allusions contained in them, are satisfactory
proofs to decide the merits of rival families, or even to
fix the limits of those rude estates which such a society
can possess. We therefore find, that the professed reciters
and composers of these songs are the recognized
judges in all disputed matters; and as they are often
priests, and believed to be inspired, it is probably in this
way that the notion of the divine origin of poetry first
arose.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> These ballads will, of course, vary, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the customs and temperaments of the different nations,
and according to the climate to which they are accustomed.
In the south they assume a passionate and voluptuous
form; in the north they are rather remarkable for
their tragic and warlike character.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> But, notwithstanding
these diversities, all such productions have one feature
in common. They are not only founded on truth, but
making allowance for the colourings of poetry, they are
all strictly true. Men who are constantly repeating songs
which they constantly hear, and who appeal to the authorized
singers of them as final umpires in disputed questions,
are not likely to be mistaken on matters, in the
accuracy of which they have so lively an interest.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>This is the earliest, and most simple, of the various
stages through which history is obliged to pass. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
in the course of time, unless unfavourable circumstances
intervene, society advances, and, among other changes,
there is one in particular of the greatest importance: I
mean the introduction of the art of writing, which, before
many generations are passed, must effect a complete
alteration in the character of the national traditions.
The manner in which this occurs has, so far as I am
aware, never been pointed out; and it will, therefore, be
interesting to attempt to trace some of its details.</p>

<p>The first, and perhaps the most obvious consideration,
is that the introduction of the art of writing gives permanence
to the national knowledge, and thus lessens the
utility of that oral information, in which all the acquirements
of an unlettered people must be contained. Hence
it is, that as a country advances, the influence of tradition
diminishes, and traditions themselves become less
trustworthy.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Besides this, the preservers of these
traditions lose, in this stage of society, much of their
former reputation. Among a perfectly unlettered people,
the singers of ballads are, as we have already seen, the
sole depositories of those historical facts on which the
fame, and often the property, of their chieftains principally
depend. But, when this same nation becomes
acquainted with the art of writing, it grows unwilling
to intrust these matters to the memory of itinerant
singers, and avails itself of its new art to preserve them
in a fixed and material form. As soon as this is effected,
the importance of those who repeat the national traditions
is sensibly diminished. They gradually sink into
an inferior class, which, having lost its old reputation,
no longer consists of those superior men to whose abilities
it owed its former fame.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Thus we see, that
although, without letters, there can be no knowledge of
much importance, it is nevertheless true, that their introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
is injurious to historical traditions in two distinct
ways: first by weakening the traditions, and secondly
by weakening the class of men whose occupation it is to
preserve them.</p>

<p>But this is not all. Not only does the art of writing
lessen the number of traditionary truths, but it directly
encourages the propagation of falsehoods. This is
effected by what may be termed a principle of accumulation,
to which all systems of belief have been deeply
indebted. In ancient times, for example, the name of
Hercules was given to several of those great public
robbers who scourged mankind, and who, if their
crimes were successful, as well as enormous, were sure
after their death to be worshipped as heroes.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> How
this appellation originated is uncertain; but it was
probably bestowed at first on a single man, and afterwards
on those who resembled him in the character of
their achievements.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> This mode of extending the use
of a single name is natural to a barbarous people;<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
and would cause little or no confusion, as long as the
traditions of the country remained local and unconnected.
But as soon as these traditions became fixed
by a written language, the collectors of them, deceived
by the similarity of name, assembled the scattered
facts, and, ascribing to a single man these accumulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
exploits, degraded history to the level of a miraculous
mythology.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> In the same way, soon after the use of
letters was known in the North of Europe, there was
drawn up by Saxo Grammaticus the life of the celebrated
Ragnar Lodbrok. Either from accident or
design, this great warrior of Scandinavia, who had
taught England to tremble, had received the same
name as another Ragnar, who was prince of Jutland
about a hundred years earlier. This coincidence would
have caused no confusion, as long as each district preserved
a distinct and independent account of its own
Ragnar. But, by possessing the resource of writing,
men became able to consolidate the separate trains of
events, and, as it were, fuse two truths into one error.
And this was what actually happened. The credulous
Saxo put together the different exploits of both Ragnars,
and, ascribing the whole of them to his favourite
hero, has involved in obscurity one of the most interesting
parts of the early history of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>The annals of the North afford another curious instance
of this source of error. A tribe of Finns, called
Quæns, occupied a considerable part of the eastern
coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. Their country was known
as Quænland; and this name gave rise to a belief that,
to the north of the Baltic, there was a nation of Amazons.
This would easily have been corrected by local
knowledge; but, by the use of writing, the flying
rumour was at once fixed; and the existence of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
people is positively affirmed in some of the earliest
European histories.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Thus, too, Abo, the ancient
capital of Finland, was called Turku, which, in the
Swedish language, means a market-place. Adam of
Bremen, having occasion to treat of the countries adjoining
the Baltic,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> was so misled by the word Turku,
that this celebrated historian assures his readers that
there were Turks in Finland.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>To these illustrations many others might be added,
showing how mere names deceived the early historians,
and gave rise to relations which were entirely
false, and might have been rectified on the spot; but
which, owing to the art of writing, were carried into
distant countries, and thus placed beyond the reach of
contradiction. Of such cases, one more may be mentioned,
as it concerns the history of England. Richard I.,
the most barbarous of our princes, was known to his
contemporaries as the Lion; an appellation conferred
upon him on account of his fearlessness, and the ferocity
of his temper.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Hence it was said that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the heart of a lion; and the title C&oelig;ur de Lion not
only became indissolubly connected with his name, but
actually gave rise to a story, repeated by innumerable
writers, according to which he slew a lion in single
combat.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The name gave rise to the story; the story
confirmed the name; and another fiction was added to
that long series of falsehoods of which history mainly
consisted during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The corruptions of history, thus naturally brought
about by the mere introduction of letters, were, in
Europe, aided by an additional cause. With the art
of writing, there was, in most cases, also communicated
a knowledge of Christianity; and the new religion
not only destroyed many of the Pagan traditions, but
falsified the remainder, by amalgamating them with
monastic legends. The extent to which this was carried
would form a curious subject for inquiry; but one
or two instances of it will perhaps be sufficient to satisfy
the generality of readers.</p>

<p>Of the earliest state of the great Northern nations
we have little positive evidence; but several of the lays
in which the Scandinavian poets related the feats of
their ancestors, or of their contemporaries, are still
preserved; and, notwithstanding their subsequent corruption,
it is admitted by the most competent judges
that they embody real and historical events. But in
the ninth and tenth centuries, Christian missionaries
found their way across the Baltic, and introduced a
knowledge of their religion among the inhabitants of
Northern Europe.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Scarcely was this effected, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the sources of history began to be poisoned. At the
end of the eleventh century, Sæmund Sigfussen, a
Christian priest, gathered the popular, and hitherto
unwritten, histories of the North into what is called
the Elder Edda; and he was satisfied with adding to
his compilation the corrective of a Christian hymn.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
A hundred years later, there was made another collection
of the native histories; but the principle which I
have mentioned, having had a longer time to operate,
now displayed its effects still more clearly. In this
second collection, which is known by the name of the
Younger Edda, there is an agreeable mixture of Greek,
Jewish, and Christian fables; and, for the first time in
the Scandinavian annals, we meet with the widely
diffused fiction of a Trojan descent.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>If, by way of further illustration, we turn to other
parts of the world, we shall find a series of facts confirming
this view. We shall find that, in those countries
where there has been no change of religion, history is
more trustworthy and connected than in those countries
where such a change has taken place. In India, Brahmanism,
which is still supreme, was established at so
early a period, that its origin is lost in the remotest
antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> The consequence is, that the native annals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
have never been corrupted by any new superstition;
and the Hindus are possessed of historic traditions
more ancient than can be found among any other Asiatic
people.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> In the same way, the Chinese have for upwards
of 2,000 years preserved the religion of Fo, which
is a form of Buddhism.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> In China, therefore, though
the civilization has never been equal to that of India,
there is a history, not, indeed, as old as the natives
would wish us to believe, but still stretching back to
several centuries before the Christian era, from whence
it has been brought down to our own times in an uninterrupted
succession.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> On the other hand, the Persians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
whose intellectual development was certainly superior
to that of the Chinese, are nevertheless without any
authentic information respecting the early transactions
of their ancient monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> For this I can see no
possible reason, except the fact, that Persia, soon after
the promulgation of the Koran, was conquered by the
Mohammedans, who completely subverted the Parsee
religion, and thus interrupted the stream of the national
traditions.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Hence it is that, putting aside the myths
of the Zendavesta, we have no native authorities for
Persian history of any value, until the appearance, in
the eleventh century, of the Shah Nameh; in which,
however, Ferdousi has mingled the miraculous relations
of those two religions by which his country had been
successively subjected.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> The result is, that if it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
not for the various discoveries which have been made,
of monuments, inscriptions, and coins, we should be
compelled to rely on the scanty and inaccurate details
in the Greek writers for our knowledge of the history
of one of the most important of the Asiatic monarchies.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>Even among more barbarous nations, we see the same
principle at work. The Malayo-Polynesian race is well
known to ethnologists, as covering an immense series of
islands, extending from Madagascar to within 2,000
miles of the western coast of America.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of these widely scattered people was originally Polytheism,
of which the purest forms were long preserved
in the Philippine Islands.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> But in the fifteenth century,
many of the Polynesian nations were converted
to Mohammedanism;<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> and this was followed by a process
precisely the same as that which I have pointed
out in other countries. The new religion, by changing
the current of the national thoughts, corrupted the
purity of the national history. Of all the islands in
the Indian Archipelago, Java was the one which
reached the highest civilization.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Now, however, the
Javanese have not only lost their historical traditions,
but even those lists of their kings which are extant
are interpolated with the names of Mohammedan
saints.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> On the other hand, we find that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
adjacent island of Bali, where the old religion is still
preserved,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> the legends of Java are remembered and
cherished by the people.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p>It would be useless to adduce further evidence respecting
the manner in which, among an imperfectly
civilized people, the establishment of a new religion will
always affect the accuracy of their early history. I
need only observe, that in this way the Christian priests
have obscured the annals of every European people they
converted, and have destroyed or corrupted the traditions
of the Gauls,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> of the Welsh, of the Irish,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> of
the Anglo-Saxons,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> of the Sclavonic nations,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> of the
Finns,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> and even of the Icelanders.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Besides all this, there occurred other circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
tending in the same direction. Owing to events which
I shall hereafter explain, the literature of Europe,
shortly before the final dissolution of the Roman
Empire, fell entirely into the hands of the clergy, who
were long venerated as the sole instructors of mankind.
For several centuries, it was extremely rare to meet
with a layman who could read or write; and of course
it was still rarer to meet with one able to compose a
work. Literature, being thus monopolized by a single
class, assumed the peculiarities natural to its new
masters.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> And as the clergy, taken as a body, have
always looked on it as their business to enforce belief,
rather than encourage inquiry, it is no wonder if they
displayed in their writings the spirit incidental to the
habits of their profession. Hence, as I have already
observed, literature, during many ages, instead of
benefiting society, injured it, by increasing credulity,
and thus stopping the progress of knowledge. Indeed,
the aptitude for falsehood became so great, that there
was nothing men were unwilling to believe. Nothing
came amiss to their greedy and credulous ears. Histories
of omens, prodigies, apparitions, strange portents,
monstrous appearances in the heavens, the wildest and
most incoherent absurdities, were repeated from mouth
to mouth, and copied from book to book, with as much
care as if they were the choicest treasures of human
wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> That Europe should ever have emerged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
from such a state, is the most decisive proof of the
extraordinary energy of Man, since we cannot even
conceive a condition of society more unfavourable to
his progress. But it is evident, that until the emancipation
was effected, the credulity and looseness of
thought which were universal, unfitted men for habits
of investigation, and made it impossible for them to
engage in a successful study of past affairs, or even
record with accuracy what was taking place around
them.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>If, therefore, we recur to the facts just cited, we may
say that, omitting several circumstances altogether
subordinate, there were three leading causes of the
corruption of the history of Europe in the Middle
Ages. The first cause was, the sudden introduction
of the art of writing, and the consequent fusion of
different local traditions, which, when separate, were
accurate, but when united were false. The second
cause was, the change of religion; which acted in two
ways, producing not merely an interruption of the old
traditions, but also an interpolation of them. And the
third cause, probably the most powerful of all, was,
that history became monopolized by a class of men
whose professional habits made them quick to believe,
and who, moreover, had a direct interest in increasing
the general credulity, since it was the basis upon which
their own authority was built.</p>

<p>By the operation of these causes, the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Europe became corrupted to an extent for which we
can find no parallel in any other period. That there
was, properly speaking, no history, was the smallest
part of the inconvenience; but, unhappily, men, not
satisfied with the absence of truth, supplied its place
by the invention of falsehood. Among innumerable
instances of this, there is one species of inventions
worth noticing, because they evince that love of antiquity,
which is a marked characteristic of those
classes by whom history was then written. I allude
to fictions regarding the origin of different nations, in
all of which the spirit of the Middle Ages is very discernible.
During many centuries, it was believed by
every people that they were directly descended from
ancestors who had been present at the siege of Troy.
That was a proposition which no one thought of doubting.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
The only question was, as to the details of so illustrious
a lineage. On this, however, there was a certain
unanimity of opinion; since, not to mention inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
countries, it was admitted that the French were descended
from Francus, whom everybody knew to be
the son of Hector; and it was also known that the
Britons came from Brutus, whose father was no other
than Æneas himself.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>Touching the origin of particular places, the great
historians of the Middle Ages are equally communicative.
In the accounts they give of them, as well as
in the lives they write of eminent men, the history
usually begins at a very remote period; and the events
relating to their subject are often traced back, in an
unbroken series, from the moment when Noah left the
ark, or even when Adam passed the gates of Paradise.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
On other occasions, the antiquity they assign is somewhat
less; but the range of their information is always
extraordinary. They say, that the capital of France is
called after Paris, the son of Priam, because he fled
there when Troy was overthrown.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> They also mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that Tours owed its name to being the burial-place of
Turonus, one of the Trojans;<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> while the city of Troyes
was actually built by the Trojans, as its etymology
clearly proves.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> It was well ascertained that Nuremberg
was called after the Emperor Nero;<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> and Jerusalem
after King Jebus,<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> a man of vast celebrity in the Middle
Ages, but whose existence later historians have not
been able to verify. The river Humber received its
name because, in ancient times, a king of the Huns
had been drowned in it.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> The Gauls derived their
origin, according to some, from Galathia, a female
descendant of Japhet; according to others, from Gomer,
the son of Japhet.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Prussia was called after Prussus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
a brother of Augustus.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> This was remarkably modern;
but Silesia had its name from the prophet Elisha&mdash;from
whom, indeed, the Silesians descended;<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> while as to
the city of Zurich, its exact date was a matter of dispute,
but it was unquestionably built in the time of
Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> It was likewise from Abraham and Sarah
that the gipsies immediately sprung.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> The blood of
the Saracens was less pure, since they were only
descended from Sarah&mdash;in what way it is not mentioned;
but she probably had them by another marriage,
or, may be, as the fruit of an Egyptian intrigue.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> At
all events, the Scotch certainly came from Egypt; for
they were originally the issue of Scota, who was a
daughter of Pharaoh, and who bequeathed to them her
name.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> On sundry similar matters, the Middle Ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
possessed information equally valuable. It was well
known that the city of Naples was founded on eggs;<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
and it was also known, that the order of St. Michael
was instituted in person by the archangel, who was
himself the first knight, and to whom, in fact, chivalry
owes its origin.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> In regard to the Tartars, that people,
of course, proceeded from Tartarus; which some theologians
said was an inferior kind of hell, but others
declared to be hell itself.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> However this might be,
the fact of their birth-place being from below was
indisputable, and was proved by many circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
which showed the fatal and mysterious influence they
were able to exercise. For the Turks were identical
with the Tartars; and it was notorious, that since the
Cross had fallen into Turkish hands, all Christian
children had ten teeth less than formerly; a universal
calamity, which there seemed to be no means of repairing.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>Other points relating to the history of past events
were cleared up with equal facility. In Europe during
many centuries, the only animal food in general use
was pork; beef, veal, and mutton, being comparatively
unknown.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> It was, therefore, with no small astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
that the crusaders, on returning from the East,
told their countrymen that they had been among a
people who, like the Jews, thought pork unclean, and
refused to eat it. But the feelings of lively wonder
which this intelligence excited, were destroyed as soon
as the cause of the fact was explained. The subject
was taken up by Mathew Paris, the most eminent historian
during the thirteenth century, and one of the
most eminent during the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> This celebrated
writer informs us, that the Mohammedans refuse
to eat pork on account of a singular circumstance which
happened to their prophet. It appears that Mohammed,
having, on one occasion, gorged himself with food and
drink till he was in a state of insensibility, fell asleep
on a dunghill, and, in this disgraceful condition, was
seen by a litter of pigs. The pigs attacked the fallen
prophet, and suffocated him to death; for which reason
his followers abominate pigs, and refuse to partake of
their flesh.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> This striking fact explains one great
peculiarity of the Mohammedans;<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> and another fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
equally striking, explains how it was that their sect
came into existence. For it was well known, that
Mohammed was originally a cardinal, and only became
a heretic because he failed in his design of being elected
pope.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the early history of Christianity, the
great writers of the Middle Ages were particularly
inquisitive; and they preserved the memory of events,
of which otherwise we should have been entirely ignorant.
After Froissart, the most celebrated historian
of the fourteenth century, was certainly Mathew of
Westminster, with whose name, at least, most readers
are familiar. This eminent man directed his attention,
among other matters, to the history of Judas, in order
to discover the circumstances under which the character
of that arch-apostate was formed. His researches seem
to have been very extensive; but their principal results
were, that Judas, when an infant, was deserted by his
parents, and exposed on an island called Scarioth, from
whence he received the name of Judas Iscariot. To this
the historian adds, that after Judas grew up, he, among
other enormities, slew his own father, and then married
his own mother.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> The same writer, in another part of
his history, mentions a fact interesting to those who
study the antiquities of the Holy See. Some questions
had been raised as to the propriety of kissing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
pope's toe, and even theologians had their doubts
touching so singular a ceremony. But this difficulty
also was set at rest by Mathew of Westminster, who
explains the true origin of the custom. He says, that
formerly it was usual to kiss the hand of his holiness;
but that towards the end of the eighth century, a certain
lewd woman, in making an offering to the pope,
not only kissed his hand, but also pressed it. The
pope&mdash;his name was Leo&mdash;seeing the danger, cut off
his hand, and thus escaped the contamination to which
he had been exposed. Since that time, the precaution
has been taken of kissing the pope's toe instead of his
hand; and lest any one should doubt the accuracy of
this account, the historian assures us that the hand,
which had been cut off five or six hundred years before,
still existed in Rome, and was indeed a standing
miracle, since it was preserved in the Lateran in its
original state, free from corruption.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> And as some
readers might wish to be informed respecting the
Lateran itself, where the hand was kept, this also is
considered by the historian, in another part of his
great work, where he traces it back to the emperor
Nero. For it is said that this wicked persecutor of
the faith, on one occasion, vomited a frog covered with
blood, which he believed to be his own progeny, and
therefore caused to be shut up in a vault, where it
remained hidden for some time. Now, in the Latin
language, <i>latente</i> means hidden, and <i>rana</i> means a
frog; so that, by putting these two words together,
we have the origin of the Lateran, which, in fact, was
built where the frog was found.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>It would be easy to fill volumes with similar notions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
all of which were devoutly believed in those ages of
darkness, or, as they have been well called, Ages of
Faith. Those, indeed, were golden days for the ecclesiastical
profession, since the credulity of men had
reached a height which seemed to ensure to the clergy
a long and universal dominion. How the prospects of
the church were subsequently darkened, and how the
human reason began to rebel, will be related in another
part of this Introduction, where I shall endeavour to
trace the rise of that secular and sceptical spirit to
which European civilization owes its origin. But, before
closing the present chapter, it may be well to give
a few more illustrations of the opinions held in the
Middle Ages; and, for this purpose, I will select the
two historical accounts, which, of all others, were the
most popular, exercised most influence, and were most
universally believed.</p>

<p>The histories to which I refer, are those of Arthur
and Charlemagne; both of which bear the names of
dignitaries of the church, and were received with the
respect due to their illustrious authors. That concerning
Charlemagne is called the Chronicle of Turpin,
and purports to be written by Turpin, archbishop of
Rheims, a friend of the emperor and his companion in
war.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> From some passages it contains, there is reason
to think that it was really composed at the beginning
of the twelfth century;<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> but, in the Middle Ages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
men were not nice in these matters, and no one was
likely to dispute its authenticity. Indeed, the name
of an archbishop of Rheims was sufficient recommendation;
and we find accordingly, that in the year 1122
it received the formal approbation of the pope;<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> and
that Vincent de Beauvais, one of the most celebrated
writers in the thirteenth century, and tutor to the
sons of Louis IX., mentions it as a work of value,
and as being the principal authority for the reign of
Charlemagne.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>A book thus generally read, and sanctioned by such
competent judges, must be a tolerable standard for
testing the knowledge and opinions of those times.
On this account, a short notice of it will be useful for
our present purpose, as it will enable us to understand
the extreme slowness with which history has improved,
and the almost imperceptible steps by which it advanced,
until fresh life was breathed into it by the
great thinkers of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In the Chronicle of Turpin, we are informed that
the invasion of Spain by Charlemagne took place in
consequence of the direct instigation of St. James, the
brother of St. John.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> The apostle, being the cause of
the attack, adopted measures to secure its success.
When Charlemagne besieged Pamplona, that city made
an obstinate resistance; but as soon as prayers were
offered up by the invaders, the walls suddenly fell to
the ground.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> After this, the emperor rapidly overran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the whole country, almost annihilated the Mohammedans,
and built innumerable churches.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> But, the resources
of Satan are inexhaustible. On the side of the
enemy, a giant now appeared, whose name was Fenacute,
and who was descended from Goliath of old.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
This Fenacute was the most formidable opponent the
Christians had yet encountered. His strength was
equal to that of forty men;<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> his face measured one
cubit; his arms and legs four cubits; his total height
was twenty cubits. Against him Charlemagne sent
the most eminent warriors; but they were easily discomfited
by the giant; of whose prodigious force some
idea may be formed from the fact, that the length even
of his fingers was three palms.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The Christians were
filled with consternation. In vain did more than twenty
chosen men advance against the giant; not one returned
from the field; Fenacute took them all under his arms,
and carried them off into captivity.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> At length the
celebrated Orlando came forward, and challenged him
to mortal combat. An obstinate fight ensued; and the
Christian, not meeting with the success he expected,
engaged his adversary in a theological discussion.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
Here the pagan was easily defeated; and Orlando,
warmed by the controversy, pressed on his enemy,
smote the giant with his sword, and dealt him a fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
wound. After this, the last hope of the Mohammedans
was extinct; the Christian arms had finally
triumphed, and Charlemagne divided Spain among
those gallant followers who had aided him in effecting
its conquest.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>On the history of Arthur, the Middle Ages possessed
information equally authentic. Different accounts had
been circulated respecting this celebrated king;<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> but
their comparative value was still unsettled, when, early
in the twelfth century, the subject attracted the attention
of Geoffrey, the well-known Archdeacon of Monmouth.
This eminent man, in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1147, published the
result of his inquiries, in a work which he called
<i>History of the Britons</i>.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> In this book, he takes a
comprehensive view of the whole question; and not
only relates the life of Arthur, but also traces the circumstances
which prepared the way for the appearance
of that great conqueror. In regard to the actions of
Arthur, the historian was singularly fortunate, inasmuch
as the materials necessary for that part of his
subject were collected by Walter Archdeacon of Oxford,
who was a friend of Geoffrey, and who, like him, took
great interest in the study of history.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The work is,
therefore, the joint composition of the two archdeacons;
and is entitled to respect, not only on this account, but
also because it was one of the most popular of all the
productions of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The earlier part of this great history is occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
with the result of those researches which the Archdeacon
of Monmouth had made into the state of Britain
before the accession of Arthur. With this we are not
so much concerned; though it may be mentioned, that
the archdeacon ascertained that, after the capture of
Troy, Ascanius fled from the city, and begat a son,
who became father to Brutus.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> In those days, England
was peopled by giants, all of whom were slain by
Brutus; who, having extirpated the entire race, built
London, settled the affairs of the country, and called
it, after himself, by the name of Britain.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The archdeacon
proceeds to relate the actions of a long line of
kings who succeeded Brutus, most of whom were remarkable
for their abilities, and some were famous for
the prodigies which occurred in their time. Thus,
during the government of Rivallo, it rained blood for
three consecutive days;<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> and when Morvidus was on
the throne, the coasts were infested by a horrid sea-monster,
which, having devoured innumerable persons,
at length swallowed the king himself.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>These and similar matters are related by the Archdeacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of Monmouth as the fruit of his own inquiries;
but in the subsequent account of Arthur, he was aided
by his friend the Archdeacon of Oxford. The two
archdeacons inform their readers, that King Arthur
owed his existence to a magical contrivance of Merlin,
the celebrated wizard; the particulars of which they
relate with a minuteness which, considering the sacred
character of the historians, is rather remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> The
subsequent actions of Arthur did not belie his supernatural
origin. His might nothing was able to withstand.
He slew an immense number of Saxons; he
overran Norway, invaded Gaul, fixed his court at
Paris, and made preparations to effect the conquest of
all Europe.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> He engaged two giants in single combat,
and killed them both. One of these giants, who
inhabited the Mount of St. Michael, was the terror of
the whole country, and destroyed all the soldiers sent
against him, except those he took prisoners, in order to
eat them while they were yet alive.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> But he fell a
victim to the prowess of Arthur; as also did another
giant, named Ritho, who was, if possible, still more
formidable. For Ritho, not content with warring on
men of the meaner sort, actually clothed himself in
furs which were entirely made of the beards of the
kings he had killed.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>Such were the statements which, under the name of
history, were laid before the world in the twelfth century;
and that, too, not by obscure writers, but by
high dignitaries of the church. Nor was anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
wanting by which the success of the work might be
ensured. Its vouchers were the Archdeacon of Monmouth,
and the Archdeacon of Oxford; it was dedicated
to Robert Earl of Gloucester, the son of Henry I.;
and it was considered so important a contribution to
the national literature, that its principal author was
raised to the bishopric of Asaph,&mdash;a preferment which
he is said to owe to his success in investigating the
annals of English history.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> A book thus stamped
with every possible mark of approbation, is surely no
bad measure of the age in which it was admired. Indeed,
the feeling was so universal, that, during several
centuries, there are not more than two or three instances
of any critic suspecting its accuracy.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> A Latin abridgment
of it was published by the well-known historian,
Alfred of Beverley;<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> and, in order that it might be
more generally known, it was translated into English
by Layamon,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> and into Anglo-Norman, first by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Gaimar, and afterwards by Wace;<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> zealous men, who
were anxious that the important truths it contained
should be diffused as widely as circumstances would
allow.</p>

<p>It will hardly be necessary that I should adduce further
evidence of the way in which history was written
during the Middle Ages; for the preceding specimens
have not been taken at random, but have been selected
from the ablest and most celebrated authors; and as
such present a very favourable type of the knowledge
and judgment of Europe in those days. In the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, there appeared, for the
first time, faint signs of an approaching change;<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> but
this improvement was not very marked until late in the
sixteenth century, or even early in the seventeenth.
The principal steps of this interesting movement will
be traced in another part of the Introduction, when I
shall show, that although in the seventeenth century
the progress was unmistakable, there was no attempt
to take a comprehensive view of history until nearly
the middle of the eighteenth century; when the subject
was studied, first by the great French thinkers, then
by one or two of the Scotch, and, some years later, by
the Germans. This reformation of history was connected,
as I shall point out, with other intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
changes, which corresponded to it, and which affected
the social relations of all the principal countries of
Europe. But, without anticipating what will be found
in another part of this volume, it is sufficient to say,
that not only was no history written before the end of
the sixteenth century, but that the state of society was
such as to make it impossible for one to be written.
The knowledge of Europe was not yet ripe enough to
enable it to be successfully applied to the study of past
events. For we are not to suppose that the deficiencies
of the early historians were caused by a lack of natural
abilities. The average intellect of men is probably
always the same; but the pressure exercised on them
by society is constantly varying. It was, therefore,
the general condition of society, which, in former days,
compelled even the ablest writers to believe the most
childish absurdities. Until that condition was altered,
the existence of history was impossible, because it
was impossible to find any one who knew what was
most important to relate, what to reject, and what to
believe.</p>

<p>The consequence was, that even when history was
studied by men of such eminent abilities as Macchiavelli
and Bodin, they could turn it to no better account than
to use it as a vehicle for political speculations; and in
none of their works do we find the least attempt to
rise to generalizations large enough to include all
the social phenomena. The same remark applies to
Comines, who, though inferior to Macchiavelli and
Bodin, was an observer of no ordinary acuteness, and
certainly displays a rare sagacity in his estimation of
particular characters. But this was due to his own
intellect; while the age in which he lived made him
superstitious, and, for the larger purposes of history,
miserably shortsighted. His shortsightedness is strikingly
shown in his utter ignorance of that great intellectual
movement, which, in his own time, was rapidly
overthrowing the feudal institutions of the Middle
Ages; but to which he never once alludes, reserving
his attention for those trivial political intrigues in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
relation of which he believed history to consist.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> As
to his superstition, it would be idle to give many instances
of that; since no man could live in the fifteenth
century without having his mind enfeebled by the
universal credulity. It may, however, be observed,
that though he was personally acquainted with statesmen
and diplomatists, and had, therefore, the fullest
opportunity of seeing how enterprises of the fairest
promise are constantly ruined, merely by the incapacity
of those who undertake them, he, on all important
occasions, ascribes such failure, not to the real cause,
but to the immediate interference of the Deity. So
marked, and so irresistible, was the tendency of the
fifteenth century, that this eminent politician, a man of
the world, and well skilled in the arts of life, deliberately
asserts that battles are lost, not because the army
is ill supplied, nor because the campaign is ill conceived,
nor because the general is incompetent; but because
the people or their prince are wicked, and Providence
seeks to punish them. For, says Comines, war is a
great mystery; and being used by God as the means of
accomplishing his wishes, He gives victory, sometimes
to one side, sometimes to the other.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> Hence, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
disturbances occur in the state, solely by divine disposition;
and they never would happen, except that
princes or kingdoms, having become prosperous,
forget the source from which their prosperity proceeded.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>Such attempts as these, to make politics a mere
branch of theology,<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> are characteristic of the time;
and they are the more interesting, as the work of a man
of great ability, and of one, too, who had grown old in
the experience of public life. When views of this sort
were advocated, not by a monk in his cloister, but by a
distinguished statesman, well versed in public affairs,
we may easily imagine what was the average intellectual
condition of those who were every way his inferiors.
It is but too evident, that from them nothing could be
expected; and that many steps had yet to be taken,
before Europe could emerge from the superstition in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
which it was sunk, and break through those grievous
impediments which hindered its future progress.</p>

<p>But, though much remained to be done, there can be
no doubt that the movement onward was uninterrupted,
and that, even while Comines was writing, there were
unequivocal symptoms of a great and decisive change.
Still, they were only indications of what was approaching;
and about a hundred years elapsed, after his death,
before the progress was apparent in the whole of its
results. For, though the Protestant Reformation was
a consequence of this progress, it was for some time
unfavourable to it, by encouraging the ablest men in
the discussion of questions inaccessible to human reason,
and thus diverting them from subjects in which their
efforts would have been available for the general purposes
of civilization. Hence we find, that little was
really accomplished until the end of the sixteenth century,
when, as we shall see in the next two chapters,
the theological fervour began to subside in England
and France, and the way was prepared for that purely
secular philosophy, of which Bacon and Descartes were
the exponents, but by no means the creators.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> This
epoch belongs to the seventeenth century, and from it
we may date the intellectual regeneration of Europe;
just as from the eighteenth century we may date its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
social regeneration. But during the greater part of the
sixteenth century, the credulity was still universal,
since it affected not merely the lowest and most ignorant
classes, but even those who were best educated. Of
this innumerable proofs might be given; though, for
the sake of brevity, I will confine myself to two
instances, which are particularly striking, from the
circumstances attending them, and from the influence
they exercised over men who might be supposed little
liable to similar delusions.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifteenth, and early in the sixteenth
century, St&oelig;ffler, the celebrated astronomer, was professor
of mathematics at Tübingen. This eminent man
rendered great services to astronomy, and was one of
the first who pointed out the way of remedying the
errors in the Julian calendar, according to which time
was then computed.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> But neither his abilities nor
his knowledge could protect him against the spirit of
his age. In 1524, he published the result of some
abstruse calculations, in which he had been long engaged,
and by which he had ascertained the remarkable
fact, that in that same year the world would again be
destroyed by a deluge. This announcement, made by a
man of such eminence, and made, too, with the utmost
confidence, caused a lively and universal alarm.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
News of the approaching event was rapidly circulated,
and Europe was filled with consternation. To avoid
the first shock, those who had houses by the sea, or on
rivers, abandoned them;<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> while others, perceiving that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
such measures could only be temporary, adopted more
active precautions. It was suggested that, as a preliminary
step, the Emperor Charles V. should appoint
inspectors to survey the country, and mark those places
which, being least exposed to the coming flood, would
be most likely to afford a shelter. That this should be
done, was the wish of the imperial general, who was
then stationed at Florence, and by whose desire a work
was written recommending it.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> But the minds of
men were too distracted for so deliberate a plan; and
besides, as the height of the flood was uncertain, it was
impossible to say whether it would not reach the top of
the most elevated mountains. In the midst of these
and similar schemes, the fatal day drew near, and nothing
had yet been contrived on a scale large enough
to meet the evil. To enumerate the different proposals
which were made and rejected, would fill a long chapter.
One proposal is, however, worth noticing, because it
was carried into effect with great zeal, and is, moreover,
very characteristic of the age. An ecclesiastic of the
name of Auriol, who was then professor of canon law
at the University of Toulouse, revolved in his own
mind various expedients by which this universal disaster
might be mitigated. At length it occurred to him
that it was practicable to imitate the course which, on
a similar emergency, Noah had adopted with eminent
success. Scarcely was the idea conceived, when it was
put into execution. The inhabitants of Toulouse lent
their aid; and an ark was built, in the hope that some
part, at least, of the human species might be preserved,
to continue their race, and repeople the earth, after the
waters should have subsided, and the land again become
dry.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>About seventy years after this alarm had passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
away, there happened another circumstance, which for
a time afforded occupation to the most celebrated men
in one of the principal countries of Europe. At the
end of the sixteenth century, terrible excitement was
caused by a report that a golden tooth had appeared in
the jaw of a child born in Silesia. The rumour, on
being investigated, turned out to be too true. It became
impossible to conceal it from the public; and the
miracle was soon known all over Germany, where, being
looked on as a mysterious omen, universal anxiety was
felt as to what this new thing might mean. Its real
import was first unfolded by Dr. Horst. In 1595, this
eminent physician published the result of his researches,
by which it appears that, at the birth of the child, the
sun was in conjunction with Saturn, at the sign Aries.
The event, therefore, though supernatural, was by no
means alarming. The golden tooth was the precursor
of a golden age, in which the emperor would drive the
Turks from Christendom, and lay the foundations of an
empire that would last for thousands of years. And
this, says Horst, is clearly alluded to by Daniel, in his
well-known second chapter, where the prophet speaks
of a statue with a golden head.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

of Scotland are noticed in <i>Barry's Hist. of the Orkney Islands</i>, p. 89;
and for a modern instance in the island of Col, near Mull, see <i>Otter's
Life of Clarke</i>, vol. i. p. 307. As to the Irish bards in the seventh
century, see <i>Sharon Turner's Hist. of England</i>, vol. iii. p. 571.
Spenser's account of them in the sixteenth century (<i>Somers Tracts</i>,
vol. i. pp. 590, 591) shows that the order was then falling into
contempt; and in the seventeenth century this is confirmed by Sir
William Temple; <i>Essay on Poetry</i>, in <i>Temple's Works</i>, vol. iii. pp.
431, 432. But it was not till the eighteenth century that they became
extinct; for Mr. Prior (<i>Life of Goldsmith</i>, vol. i. pp. 36, 37) says,
that Carolan, &lsquo;the last of the ancient Irish bards,&rsquo; died in 1738.
Without them the memory of many events would have been entirely lost;
since, even at the end of the seventeenth century, there being no
registers in Ireland, the ordinary means of recording facts were so
little known, that parents often took the precaution of having the names
and ages of children marked on their arms with gunpowder. See <i>Kirkman's
Memoirs of Charles Macklin</i>, 8vo. 1799, vol. i. pp. 144, 145, a curious
book. Compare, respecting Carolan, <i>Nichols's Illustrations of the
Eighteenth Century</i>, vol. vii. pp. 688&ndash;694.</p></div>

history of barbarous nations has been studied, that authors constantly
assert rhyme to be a comparatively recent contrivance; and even
Pinkerton, writing to Laing in 1799, says, &lsquo;Rhyme was not known in
Europe till about the ninth century.&rsquo; <i>Pinkerton's Literary
Correspondence</i>, vol. ii. p. 92. The truth is, that rhyme was not only
known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, but was used, long before the
date Pinkerton mentions, by the Anglo-Saxons, by the Irish, by the
Welsh, and, I believe, by the Brétons. See <i>Mure's Hist. of the
Literature of Greece</i>, vol. ii. p. 113; <i>Hallam's Lit. of Europe</i>, vol.
i. p. 31; <i>Villemarqué</i>, <i>Chants Populaires de la Bretagne</i>, vol. i. pp.

<i>Turner's Hist. of England</i>, vol. iii. pp. 383, 643, vol. vii.

Soc.</i> vol. ii. p. 82); by the Chinese (<i>Transac. of Asiatic Soc.</i> vol.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_431_431" id="Footnote_431_431"></a><a href="#FNanchor_431_431"><span class="label">[431]</span></a> The habit thus acquired, long survives the circumstances
which made it necessary. During many centuries, the love of
versification was so widely diffused, that works in rhyme were composed
on nearly all subjects, even in Europe; and this practice, which marks
the ascendency of the imagination, is, as I have shown, a characteristic
of the great Indian civilization, where the understanding was always in
abeyance. On early French historians who wrote in rhyme, see <i>Monteil</i>,
<i>Hist. des divers Etats</i>, vol. vi. p. 147. Montucla (<i>Hist. des
Mathémat.</i> vol. i. p. 506) mentions a mathematical treatise, written in
the thirteenth century, &lsquo;en vers techniques.&rsquo; Compare the remarks of
Matter (<i>Hist. de l'Ecole d'Alexandrie</i>, vol. ii. pp. 179&ndash;183) on the
scientific poetry of Aratus; and on that of Hygin, p. 250. Thus, too, we
find an Anglo-Norman writing &lsquo;the Institutes of Justinian in verse;&rsquo;
<i>Turner's Hist. of England</i>, vol. vii. p. 307: and a Polish historian
composing &lsquo;his numerous works on genealogy and heraldry mostly in
rhyme.&rsquo; <i>Talvi's Language and Literature of the Slavic Nations</i>, 8vo.
1850, p. 246. Compare <i>Origines du Droit Français</i>, in
<i>&#338;uvres de Michelet</i>, vol. ii. p. 310.</p></div>

the inhabitants, &lsquo;Their traditionary ballads were a kind of standard, or
classical authority, to which they referred for the purpose of
determining any disputed fact in their history.&rsquo; And when doubts arose,
&lsquo;as they had no records to which they could at such times refer, they
could only oppose one oral tradition to another; which unavoidably
involved the parties in protracted, and often obstinate debates.&rsquo;

spontaneousness (<i>Cousin</i>, <i>Hist. de la Philosophie</i>, II<sup>e</sup> série,
vol. i. pp. 135, 136); and there can be no doubt that one cause of the
reverence felt for great poets, is the necessity they seem to experience
of pouring out their thoughts without reference to their own wishes.
Still, it will, I believe, be found, that the notion of poetry being a
divine art is most rife in those states of society in which knowledge is
monopolised by the bards, and in which the bards are both priests and
historians. On this combination of pursuits, compare a note in
<i>Malcolm's Hist. of Persia</i>, vol. i. p. 90, with <i>Mure's Hist. of the
Lit. of Greece</i>, vol. i. p. 148, vol. ii. p. 228, and <i>Petrie's</i> learned
work, <i>Ecclesiastical Architecture of Ireland</i>, Dublin, 1845, p. 354.

Antiquities</i>, pp. 234&ndash;236; <i>Wheaton's Hist. of the Northmen</i>, pp. 50,

been rashly attacked by several writers, and among others by Sir Walter
Scott, see <i>Villemarqué</i>, <i>Chants Populaires</i>, vol. i. pp. xxv.&ndash;xxxi.,
and <i>Talvi's Slavic Nations</i>, p. 150. On the tenacity of oral tradition,

Denmark</i>, pp. 197, 198, 350; <i>Wheaton's Hist. of the Northmen</i>, pp. 38,
39, 57&ndash;59. Another curious illustration of this is, that several
barbarous nations continue to repeat the old traditions in the old
words, for so many generations, that at length the very language becomes
unintelligible to the majority of those who recite them. See <i>Mariner's
Account of the Tonga Islands</i>, vol. i. p. 156, vol. ii. p. 217, and

Charlemagne kept in his forests immense droves of pigs. <i>Note in Esprit

not like pork were tried by the Inquisition as suspected Jews:

frequently to make himself very ill. See <i>Ambassades de Messieurs de

&lsquo;Within a century after its first publication, it was generally adopted
by writers on English history; and during several centuries, only one or

veracity.&rsquo; And Sir Henry Ellis says of Polydore Vergil, who wrote early
in the sixteenth century, &lsquo;For the repudiation of Geoffrey of Monmouth's
history, Polydore Vergil was considered almost as a man deprived of
reason. Such were the prejudices of the time.&rsquo; <i>Polydore Vergil's

popularity, <i>Lappenberg's Hist. of the Anglo-Saxon Kings</i>, vol. i. p.

in Europe, men began to open their eyes on these matters; and Boyle, for
example, classes together &lsquo;the fabulous labours of Hercules, and
exploits of Arthur of Britain.&rsquo; <i>Boyle's Works</i>, vol. iv. p. 425.</p></div>

it was translated through the medium of Wace. But it would be more
correct to say, that Layamon made the absurdities of Geoffrey the basis
of his work, rather than translated them; for he amplifies 15,000 lines
of Wace's <i>Brut</i> into 32,000 of his own jargon. See <i>Sir F. Madden's
Preface to Layamon's Brut</i>, 8vo, 1847, vol. i. p. xiii. I cannot refrain
from bearing testimony to the great philological value of this work of
Layamon's, by the publication of which its accomplished editor has made
an important contribution towards the study of the history of the
English language. So far, however, as Layamon is concerned, we can only
contemplate with wonder an age of which he was considered an ornament.</p></div>

characters, their relations, as if they were to continue for centuries.&rsquo;

whenever Comines has occasion to mention the lower classes, which is
very rarely the case, he speaks of them with great contempt. See two

l'ordre intellectuel, que même les sciences mathématiques et physiques

quelque sort le sang qui a coulé dans les veines du monde européen

théologie.&rsquo; A noble passage, and perfectly true: but what would have
been the effect produced by Bacon and Descartes, if, instead of living
in the seventeenth century, they had lived in the seventh? Would their
philosophy have been equally secular; or, being equally secular, would
it have been equally successful?</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">OUTLINE OF THE HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH INTELLECT FROM THE
MIDDLE OF THE SIXTEENTH TO THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</div>

<p>It is difficult for an ordinary reader, living in the
middle of the nineteenth century, to understand, that
only three hundred years before he was born, the public
mind was in the benighted state disclosed in the preceding
chapter. It is still more difficult for him to
understand that the darkness was shared not merely
by men of an average education, but by men of considerable
ability, men in every respect among the
foremost of their age. A reader of this sort may
satisfy himself that the evidence is indisputable; he
may verify the statements I have brought forward, and
admit that there is no possible doubt about them; but
even then he will find it hard to conceive that there
ever was a state of society in which such miserable
absurdities were welcomed as sober and important
truths, and were supposed to form an essential part of
the general stock of European knowledge.</p>

<p>But a more careful examination will do much to dissipate
this natural astonishment. In point of fact, so
far from wondering that such things were believed, the
wonder would have been if they were rejected. For
in those times, as in all others, every thing was of a
piece. Not only in historical literature, but in all kinds
of literature, on every subject&mdash;in science, in religion,
in legislation&mdash;the presiding principle was a blind and
unhesitating credulity. The more the history of Europe
anterior to the seventeenth century is studied, the more
completely will this fact be verified. Now and then a
great man arose, who had his doubts respecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
universal belief; who whispered a suspicion as to the
existence of giants thirty feet high, of dragons with
wings, and of armies flying through the air; who
thought that astrology might be a cheat, and necromancy
a bubble; and who even went so far as to raise
a question respecting the propriety of drowning every
witch and burning every heretic. A few such men
there undoubtedly were; but they were despised as
mere theorists, idle visionaries, who, unacquainted with
the practice of life, arrogantly opposed their own reason
to the wisdom of their ancestors. In the state of society
in which they were born, it was impossible that
they should make any permanent impression. Indeed,
they had enough to do to look to themselves, and provide
for their own security; for, until the latter part
of the sixteenth century, there was no country in
which a man was not in great personal peril if he
expressed open doubts respecting the belief of his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>Yet it is evident, that until doubt began, progress
was impossible. For, as we have clearly seen, the advance
of civilization solely depends on the acquisitions
made by the human intellect, and on the extent to which
those acquisitions are diffused. But men who are perfectly
satisfied with their own knowledge, will never
attempt to increase it. Men who are perfectly convinced
of the accuracy of their opinions, will never
take the pains of examining the basis on which they
are built. They look always with wonder, and often
with horror, on views contrary to those which they
inherited from their fathers; and while they are in this
state of mind, it is impossible that they should receive
any new truth which interferes with their foregone
conclusions.</p>

<p>On this account it is, that although the acquisition
of fresh knowledge is the necessary precursor of every
step in social progress, such acquisition must itself be
preceded by a love of inquiry, and therefore by a spirit
of doubt; because without doubt there will be no inquiry,
and without inquiry there will be no knowledge.
For knowledge is not an inert and passive principle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
which comes to us whether we will or no; but it must
be sought before it can be won; it is the product of
great labour and therefore of great sacrifice. And it
is absurd to suppose that men will incur the labour,
and make the sacrifice, for subjects respecting which
they are already perfectly content. They who do not
feel the darkness, will never look for the light. If on
any point we have attained to certainty, we make no
further inquiry on that point; because inquiry would
be useless, or perhaps dangerous. The doubt must
intervene, before the investigation can begin. Here,
then, we have the act of doubting as the originator, or,
at all events, the necessary antecedent, of all progress.
Here we have that scepticism, the very name of which
is an abomination to the ignorant; because it disturbs
their lazy and complacent minds; because it troubles
their cherished superstitions; because it imposes on
them the fatigue of inquiry; and because it rouses
even sluggish understandings to ask if things are as
they are commonly supposed, and if all is really true
which they from their childhood have been taught to
believe.</p>

<p>The more we examine this great principle of scepticism,
the more distinctly shall we see the immense part it
has played in the progress of European civilization.
To state in general terms, what in this Introduction
will be fully proved, it may be said, that to scepticism
we owe that spirit of inquiry, which, during the last
two centuries, has gradually encroached on every
possible subject; has reformed every department of
practical and speculative knowledge; has weakened
the authority of the privileged classes, and thus placed
liberty on a surer foundation; has chastized the despotism
of princes; has restrained the arrogance of the
nobles; and has even diminished the prejudices of the
clergy. In a word, it is this which has remedied the
three fundamental errors of the olden time: errors
which made the people, in politics too confiding; in
science too credulous; in religion too intolerant.</p>

<p>This rapid summary of what has actually been effected,
may perhaps startle those readers to whom such large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
investigations are not familiar. The importance, however,
of the principle at issue is so great, that I purpose
in this Introduction to verify it by an examination of all
the prominent forms of European civilization. Such
an inquiry will lead to the remarkable conclusion, that
no single fact has so extensively affected the different
nations as the duration, the amount, and above all the
diffusion, of their scepticism. In Spain, the church,
aided by the Inquisition, has always been strong enough
to punish sceptical writers, and prevent, not indeed the
existence, but the promulgation of sceptical opinions.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
By this means the spirit of doubt being quenched,
knowledge has for several centuries remained almost
stationary; and civilization, which is the fruit of knowledge,
has also been stationary. But in England and
France, which, as we shall presently see, are the countries
where scepticism first openly appeared, and where
it has been most diffused, the results are altogether
different; and the love of inquiry being encouraged,
there has arisen that constantly-progressive knowledge
to which these two great nations owe their prosperity.
In the remaining part of this volume, I shall trace the
history of this principle in France and England, and
examine the different forms under which it has appeared,
and the way in which those forms have affected the
national interests. In the order of the investigation,
I shall give the precedence to England; because, for
the reasons already stated, its civilization must be
deemed more normal than that of France; and therefore,
notwithstanding its numerous deficiencies, it approaches
the natural type more closely than its great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
neighbour has been able to do. But as the fullest
details respecting English civilization will be found in
the body of the present work, I intend in the Introduction
to devote merely a single chapter to it, and to
consider our national history simply in reference to the
immediate consequences of the sceptical movement;
reserving for a future occasion those subsidiary matters
which, though less comprehensive, are still of great
value. And as the growth of religious toleration is
undoubtedly the most important of all, I will, in the
first place, state the circumstances under which it appeared
in England in the sixteenth century; and I will
then point out how other events, which immediately
followed, were part of the same progress, and were
indeed merely the same principles acting in different
directions.</p>

<p>A careful study of the history of religious toleration
will prove, that in every Christian country where it has
been adopted, it has been forced upon the clergy by the
authority of the secular classes.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> At the present day,
it is still unknown to those nations among whom the
ecclesiastical power is stronger than the temporal
power; and as this, during many centuries, was the
general condition, it is not wonderful that, in the early
history of Europe, we should find scarcely a trace of so
wise and benevolent an opinion. But at the moment
when Elizabeth mounted the throne of England, our
country was about equally divided between two hostile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
creeds; and the queen, with remarkable ability, contrived
during some time so to balance the rival powers,
as to allow to neither a decisive preponderance. This
was the first instance which had been seen in Europe
of a government successfully carried on without the
active participation of the spiritual authority; and the
consequence was, that for several years the principle of
toleration, though still most imperfectly understood,
was pushed to an extent which is truly surprising for
so barbarous an age.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> Unhappily, after a time, various
circumstances, which I shall relate in their proper
place, induced Elizabeth to change a policy which she,
even with all her wisdom, perhaps considered to be a
dangerous experiment, and for which the knowledge of
the country was as yet hardly ripe. But although she
now allowed the Protestants to gratify their hatred
against the Catholics, there was, in the midst of the
sanguinary scenes which followed, one circumstance
very worthy of remark. Although many persons were
most unquestionably executed merely for their religion,
no one ventured to state their religion as the cause of
their execution.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> The most barbarous punishments
were inflicted upon them; but they were told that they
might escape the punishment by renouncing certain
principles which were said to be injurious to the safety
of the state.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> It is true, that many of these principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
were such as no Catholic could abandon without at the
same time abandoning his religion, of which they formed
an essential part. But the mere fact that the spirit of
persecution was driven to such a subterfuge, showed
that a great progress had been made by the age. A
most important point, indeed, was gained when the
bigot became a hypocrite; and when the clergy, though
willing to burn men for the good of their souls, were
obliged to justify their cruelty by alleging considerations
of a more temporal, and, as they considered, a
less important character.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>A remarkable evidence of the change that was then
taking place, is found in the two most important theological
works which appeared in England during the
reign of Elizabeth. <i>Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity</i> was
published at the end of the sixteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
still considered one of the greatest bulwarks of our
national church. If we compare this work with <i>Jewel's
Apology for the Church of England</i>, which was written
thirty years before it,<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> we shall at once be struck by
the different methods these eminent writers employed.
Both Hooker and Jewel were men of learning and
genius. Both of them were familiar with the Bible,
the Fathers, and the Councils. Both of them wrote
with the avowed object of defending the Church of
England; and both of them were well acquainted with
the ordinary weapons of theological controversy. But
here the resemblance stops. The men were very
similar; their works are entirely different. During
the thirty years which had elapsed, the English intellect
had made immense progress; and the arguments
which in the time of Jewel were found perfectly satisfactory,
would not have been listened to in the time of
Hooker. The work of Jewel is full of quotations from
the Fathers and the Councils, whose mere assertions,
when they are uncontradicted by Scripture, he seems to
regard as positive proofs. Hooker, though he shows
much respect to the Councils, lays little stress upon
the Fathers, and evidently considered that his readers
would not pay much attention to their unsupported
opinions. Jewel inculcates the importance of faith;
Hooker insists upon the exercise of reason.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
employs all his talents in collecting the decisions of
antiquity, and in deciding upon the meaning which
they may be supposed to bear. The other quotes the
ancients, not so much from respect for their authority,
as with the view of illustrating his own arguments.
Thus, for instance, both Hooker and Jewel assert the
undoubted right of the sovereign to interfere in ecclesiastical
affairs. Jewel, however, fancied that he had
proved the right, when he had pointed out that it was
exercised by Moses, by Joshua, by David, and by
Solomon.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> On the other hand, Hooker lays down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
that this right exists, not because it is ancient, but
because it is advisable; and because it is unjust to suppose
that men who are not ecclesiastics will consent to
be bound by laws which ecclesiastics alone have framed.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
In the same opposite spirit do these great writers conduct
their defence of their own church. Jewel, like all
the authors of his time, had exercised his memory more
than his reason; and he thinks to settle the
whole dispute by crowding together texts from the
Bible, with the opinions of the commentators upon
them.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> But Hooker, who lived in the age of Shakespeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and Bacon, found himself constrained to take
views of a far more comprehensive character. His
defence rests neither upon tradition nor upon commentators,
nor ever upon revelation; but he is content that
the pretensions of the hostile parties shall be decided
by their applicability to the great exigencies of society,
and by the ease with which they adapt themselves to
the general purposes of ordinary life.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>It requires but little penetration to see the immense
importance of the change which these two great works
represent. As long as an opinion in theology was
defended by the old dogmatic method, it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
to assail it without incurring the imputation of heresy.
But when it was chiefly defended by human reasoning,
its support was seriously weakened. For by this means
the element of uncertainty was let in. It might be
alleged, that the arguments of one sect are as good as
those of another; and that we cannot be sure of the
truth of our principles, until we have heard what is to
be said on the opposite side. According to the old
theological theory, it was easy to justify the most
barbarous persecution. If a man knew that the only
true religion was the one which he professed, and if he
also knew that those who died in a contrary opinion
were doomed to everlasting perdition&mdash;if he knew
these things beyond the remotest possibility of a doubt,
he might fairly argue, that it is merciful to punish the
body in order to save the soul, and secure to immortal
beings their future salvation, even though he employed
so sharp a remedy as the halter or the stake.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> But if
this same man is taught to think that questions of religion
are to be settled by reason as well as by faith, he
can scarcely avoid the reflection, that the reason even
of the strongest minds is not infallible, since it has led
the ablest men to the most opposite conclusions. When
this idea is once diffused among a people, it cannot fail
to influence their conduct. No one of common sense
and common honesty will dare to levy upon another, on
account of his religion, the extreme penalty of the law,
when he knows it possible that his own opinions may
be wrong, and that those of the man he has punished
may be right. From the moment when questions of
religion begin to evade the jurisdiction of faith, and
submit to the jurisdiction of reason, persecution becomes
a crime of the deepest dye. Thus it was in England in
the seventeenth century. As theology became more
reasonable, it became less confident, and therefore more
merciful. Seventeen years after the publication of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
great work of Hooker, two men were publicly burned
by the English bishops, for holding heretical opinions.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>
But this was the last gasp of expiring bigotry; and
since that memorable day, the soil of England has
never been stained by the blood of a man who has
suffered for his religious creed.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>We have thus seen the rise of that scepticism which
in physics must always be the beginning of science,
and in religion must always be the beginning of toleration.
There is, indeed, no doubt that in both cases
individual thinkers may, by a great effort of original
genius, emancipate themselves from the operation of
this law. But in the progress of nations no such emancipation
is possible. As long as men refer the movements
of the comets to the immediate finger of God,
and as long as they believe that an eclipse is one of the
modes by which the Deity expresses his anger, they
will never be guilty of the blasphemous presumption
of attempting to predict such supernatural appearances.
Before they could dare to investigate the causes of
these mysterious phenomena, it is necessary that they
should believe, or at all events that they should suspect,
that the phenomena themselves were capable of being
explained by the human mind. In the same way, until
men are content in some degree to bring their religion
before the bar of their own reason, they never can
understand how it is that there should be a diversity
of creeds, or how any one can differ from themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
without being guilty of the most enormous and unpardonable
crime.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>If we now continue to trace the progress of opinions
in England, we shall see the full force of these remarks.
A general spirit of inquiry, of doubt, and even of insubordination,
began to occupy the minds of men. In
physics, it enabled them, almost at a blow, to throw
off the shackles of antiquity, and give birth to sciences
founded not on notions of old, but on individual observations
and individual experiments.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> In politics, it
stimulated them to rise against the government, and
eventually bring their king to the scaffold. In religion,
it vented itself in a thousand sects, each of which proclaimed,
and often exaggerated, the efficiency of private
judgment.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> The details of this vast movement form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
one of the most interesting parts of the history of
England: but without anticipating what I must hereafter
relate, I will at present mention only one instance,
which, from the circumstances attending it, is very
characteristic of the age. The celebrated work by
Chillingworth on the <i>Religion of Protestants</i>, is generally
admitted to be the best defence which the Reformers
have been able to make against the Church of
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> It was published in 1637,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> and the position
of the author would induce us to look for the fullest
display of bigotry that was consistent with the spirit
of his time. Chillingworth had recently abandoned
the creed which he now came forward to attack; and
he, therefore, might be expected to have that natural
inclination to dogmatize with which apostasy is usually
accompanied. Besides this, he was the godson and the
intimate friend of Laud,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> whose memory is still loathed,
as the meanest, the most cruel, and the most narrowminded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
man who ever sat on the episcopal bench.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>
He was, moreover, a fellow of Oxford, and was a constant
resident at that ancient university, which has
always been esteemed as the refuge of superstition, and
which has preserved to our own day its unenviable
fame.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> If now we turn to the work that was written
under these auspices, we can scarcely believe that it
was produced in the same generation, and in the same
country, where, only twenty-six years before, two men
had been publicly burned because they advocated
opinions different to those of the established church.
It is, indeed, a most remarkable proof of the prodigious
energy of that great movement which was now going
on, that its pressure should be felt under circumstances
the most hostile to it which can possibly be conceived;
and that a friend of Laud, and a fellow of Oxford,
should, in a grave theological treatise, lay down principles
utterly subversive of that theological spirit which
for many centuries had enslaved the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>In this great work, all authority in matters of religion
is openly set at defiance. Hooker, indeed, had
appealed from the jurisdiction of the Fathers to the
jurisdiction of reason; he had, however, been careful
to add, that the reason of individuals ought to bow
before that of the church, as we find it expressed in
great Councils, and in the general voice of ecclesiastical
tradition.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> But Chillingworth would hear of none of
these things. He would admit of no reservations which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
tended to limit the sacred right of private judgment.
He not only went far beyond Hooker in neglecting the
Fathers,<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> but he even ventured to despise the Councils.
Although the sole object of his work was to
decide on the conflicting claims of the two greatest
sects into which the Christian Church has broken, he
never quotes as authorities the Councils of that very
church respecting which the disputes were agitated.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
His strong and subtle intellect, penetrating the depths
of the subject, despised that sort of controversy which
had long busied the minds of men. In discussing the
points upon which the Catholics and Protestants were
at issue, he does not inquire whether the doctrines in
question met the approval of the early church, but he
asks if they are in accordance with human reason; and
he does not hesitate to say that, however true they may
be, no man is bound to believe them if he finds that
they are repugnant to the dictates of his own understanding.
Nor will he consent that faith should supply
the absence of authority. Even this favourite principle
of theologians is by Chillingworth made to yield to the
supremacy of the human reason.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Reason, he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
gives us knowledge; while faith only gives us belief,
which is a part of knowledge, and is, therefore, inferior
to it. It is by reason, and not by faith, that we must
discriminate in religious matters; and it is by reason
alone that we can distinguish truth from falsehood. Finally,
he solemnly reminds his readers, that in religious
matters no one ought to be expected to draw strong
conclusions from imperfect premises, or to credit improbable
statements upon scanty evidence; still less,
he says, was it ever intended that men should so prostitute
their reason, as to believe with infallible faith
that which they are unable to prove with infallible
arguments.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p>No one of ordinary reflection can fail to perceive the
manifest tendency of these opinions. But what is more
important to observe is, the process through which, in
the march of civilization, the human mind had been
obliged to pass before it could reach such elevated views.
The Reformation, by destroying the dogma of an infallible
church, had of course weakened the reverence
which was paid to ecclesiastical antiquity. Still, such
was the force of old associations, that our countrymen
long continued to respect what they had ceased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
venerate. Thus it was, that Jewel, though recognizing
the supreme authority of the Bible, had, in cases where
it was silent or ambiguous, anxiously appealed to the
early church, by whose decision he supposed all difficulties
could be easily cleared. He, therefore, only
used his reason to ascertain the discrepancies which
existed between Scripture and tradition; but when
they did not clash, he paid what is now considered a
superstitious deference to antiquity. Thirty years after
him came Hooker;<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> who made a step in advance, and
laying down principles from which Jewel would have
shrunk with fear, did much to weaken that which it
was reserved for Chillingworth utterly to destroy.
Thus it is, that these three great men represent the
three distinct epochs of the three successive generations
in which they respectively lived. In Jewel, reason is,
if I may so say, the superstructure of the system; but
authority is the basis upon which the superstructure is
built. In Hooker, authority is only the superstructure,
and reason is the basis.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> But in Chillingworth, whose
writings were harbingers of the coming storm, authority
entirely disappears, and the whole fabric of religion is
made to rest upon the way in which the unaided
reason of man shall interpret the decrees of an omnipotent
God.</p>

<p>The immense success of this great work of Chillingworth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
must have aided that movement of which it is
itself an evidence.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> It formed a decisive vindication
of religious dissent;<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> and thus justified the breaking
up of the Anglican church, which the same generation
lived to witness. Its fundamental principle was adopted
by the most influential writers of the seventeenth century,&mdash;such
as Hales, Owen, Taylor, Burnet, Tillotson,
Locke, and even the cautious and time-serving Temple;
all of whom insisted upon the authority of private judgment,
as forming a tribunal from which no one had the
power of appeal. The inference to be drawn from this
seems obvious.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> If the ultimate test of truth is individual
judgment, and if no one can affirm that the judgments
of men, which are often contradictory, can ever be
infallible, it follows of necessity that there is no decisive
criterion of religious truth. This is a melancholy, and,
as I firmly believe, a most inaccurate conclusion; but
it is one which every nation must entertain, before it
can achieve that great work of toleration, which, even
in our own country, and in our own time, is not yet
consummated. It is necessary that men should learn
to doubt, before they begin to tolerate; and that they
should recognize the fallibility of their own opinions,
before they respect the opinions of their opponents.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
This great process is far from being yet completed in
any country; and the European mind, barely emerged
from its early credulity, and from an overweening confidence
in its own belief, is still in a middle, and, so to
say, a probationary stage. When that stage shall be
finally passed, when we shall have learned to estimate
men solely by their character and their acts, and not
at all by their theological dogmas, we shall then be
able to form our religious opinions by that purely
transcendental process, of which in every age glimpses
have been granted to a few gifted minds. That this is
the direction in which things are now hastening, must
be clear to every one who has studied the progress of
modern civilization. Within the short space of three
centuries, the old theological spirit has been compelled,
not only to descend from its long-established supremacy,
but to abandon those strongholds to which, in
the face of advancing knowledge, it has vainly attempted
to secure a retreat. All its most cherished
pretensions it has been forced gradually to relinquish.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
And although in England a temporary prominence has
recently been given to certain religious controversies,
still the circumstances attending them show the alteration
in the character of the age. Disputes which, a
century ago, would have set the whole kingdom in a
flame, are now regarded with indifference by the vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
majority of educated men. The complications of modern
society, and the immense variety of interests into which
it is divided, have done much to distract the intellect,
and to prevent it from dwelling upon subjects which a
less-occupied people would deem of paramount importance.
Besides this, the accumulations of science are
far superior to those of any former age, and offer suggestions
of such surpassing interest, that nearly all our
greatest thinkers devote to them the whole of their
time, and refuse to busy themselves with matters of
mere speculative belief. The consequence is, that what
used to be considered the most important of all questions,
is now abandoned to inferior men, who mimic
the zeal, without possessing the influence of those really
great divines whose works are among the glories of our
early literature. These turbulent polemics have, indeed,
distracted the church by their clamour, but they
have not made the slightest impression upon the great
body of English intellect; and an overwhelming majority
of the nation is notoriously opposed to that monastic
and ascetic religion which it is now vainly attempted
to reconstruct. The truth is, that the time for these
things has gone by. Theological interests have long
ceased to be supreme; and the affairs of nations are no
longer regulated according to ecclesiastical views.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
England, where the march has been more rapid than
elsewhere, this change is very observable. In every
other department we have had a series of great
and powerful thinkers, who have done honour to their
country, and have won the admiration of mankind.
But for more than a century, we have not produced a
single original work in the whole field of controversial
theology. For more than a century, the apathy on this
subject has been so marked, that there has been made
no addition of value to that immense mass of divinity
which, among thinking men, is in every successive
generation losing something of its former interest.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>These are only some of the innumerable signs, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
must be discerned by every man who is not blinded by
the prejudices of an imperfect education. An immense
majority of the clergy,&mdash;some from ambitious feelings,
but the greater part, I believe, from conscientious
motives,&mdash;are striving to check the progress of that
scepticism which is now gathering in upon us from
every quarter.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> It is time that these well-intentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
though mistaken, men should see the delusion under
which they labour. That by which they are so much
alarmed, is the intermediate step which leads from
superstition to toleration. The higher order of minds
have passed through this stage, and are approaching
what is probably the ultimate form of the religious
history of the human race. But the people at large,
and even some of those who are commonly called
educated men, are only now entering that earlier epoch
in which scepticism<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> is the leading feature of the
mind. So far, therefore, from our apprehensions being
excited by this rapidly-increasing spirit, we ought
rather to do everything in our power to encourage that
which, though painful to some, is salutary to all;
because by it alone can religious bigotry be effectually
destroyed. Nor ought we to be surprised that, before
this can be done, a certain degree of suffering must
first intervene.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> If one age believes too much, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
but a natural reaction that another age should believe
too little. Such are the imperfections of our nature,
that we are compelled, by the very laws of its progress,
to pass through those crises of scepticism and of
mental distress, which to a vulgar eye are states of
national decline and national shame; but which are
only as the fire by which the gold must be purged
before it can leave its dross in the pot of the refiner.
To apply the imagery of the great allegorist, it is
necessary that the poor pilgrim, laden with the weight
of accumulated superstitions, should struggle through
the Slough of Despond and the Valley of Death, before
he can reach that glorious city, glittering with gold
and with jewels, of which the first sight is sufficient
recompense for his toils and his fears.</p>

<p>During the whole of the seventeenth century, this
double movement of scepticism and of toleration continued
to advance; though its progress was constantly
checked by the two successors of Elizabeth, who in
every thing reversed the enlightened policy of the great
queen. These princes exhausted their strength in
struggling against the tendencies of an age they were
unable to understand; but, happily, the spirit which
they wished to quench had reached a height that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
mocked their control. At the same time, the march of
the English mind was still farther aided by the nature
of those disputes which, during half a century, divided
the country. In the reign of Elizabeth, the great
contest had been between the church and its opponents;
between those who were orthodox, and those who were
heretical. But in the reigns of James and Charles,
theology was for the first time merged in politics. It
was no longer a struggle of creeds and dogmas; but
it was a struggle between those who favoured the
crown, and those who supported the parliament. The
minds of men, thus fixed upon matters of real importance,
neglected those inferior pursuits that had engrossed
the attention of their fathers.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> When, at
length, public affairs had reached their crisis, the hard
fate of the king, which eventually advanced the interests
of the throne, was most injurious to those of the
church. There can, indeed, be no doubt that the
circumstances connected with the execution of Charles,
inflicted a blow upon the whole system of ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
authority, from which, in this country, it has never
been able to recover. The violent death of the king
excited the sympathies of the people; and by thus
strengthening the hands of the royalists, hastened
the restoration of the monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> But the mere
name of that great party which had risen to power,
was suggestive of the change that, in a religious point
of view, was taking place in the national mind. It
was, indeed, no light thing, that England should be
ruled by men who called themselves Independents;
and who, under that title, not only beat back the pretensions
of the clergy, but professed an unbounded
contempt for all those rites and dogmas which the
clergy had, during many centuries, continued to amass.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
True it is, that the Independents did not always
push to their full extent the consequences of their own
doctrines.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Still, it was a great matter to have those
doctrines recognized by the constituted authorities of
the state. Besides this, it is important to remark, that
the Puritans were more fanatical than superstitious.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>
They were so ignorant of the real principles of government,
as to direct penal laws against private vices;
and to suppose that immorality could be stemmed by
legislation.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> But, notwithstanding this serious error,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
they always resisted the aggressions even of their own
clergy; and the destruction of the old episcopal hierarchy,
though perhaps too hastily effected, must have
produced many beneficial results. When the great
party by whom these things were accomplished, was at
length overthrown, the progress of events still continued
to tend in the same direction. After the Restoration,
the church, though reinstated in her ancient pomp, had
evidently lost her ancient power.<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> At the same time,
the new king, from levity, rather than from reason,
despised the disputes of theologians, and treated questions
of religion with what he considered a philosophic
indifference.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> The courtiers followed his example, and
thought they could not err in imitating him, whom they
regarded as the Lord's anointed. The results were
such as must be familiar even to the most superficial
readers of English literature. That grave and measured
scepticism, by which the Independents had been characterized,
lost all its decorum when it was transplanted
into the ungenial atmosphere of a court. The
men by whom the king was surrounded, were unequal
to the difficulties of suspense; and they attempted to
fortify their doubts by the blasphemous expression of a
wild and desperate infidelity. With scarcely an exception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
all those writers who were most favoured by
Charles, exhausted the devices of their ribald spirit, in
mocking a religion, of the nature of which they were
profoundly ignorant. These impious buffooneries
would, by themselves, have left no permanent impression
on the age; but they deserve attention, because
they were the corrupt and exaggerated representatives
of a more general tendency. They were the unwholesome
offspring of that spirit of disbelief, and of that
daring revolt against authority, which characterized the
most eminent Englishmen during the seventeenth century.
It was this which caused Locke to be an innovator
in his philosophy, and an Unitarian in his creed. It
was this which made Newton a Socinian; which forced
Milton to be the great enemy of the church, and which
not only turned the poet into a rebel, but tainted with
Arianism the <i>Paradise Lost</i>. In a word, it was the
same contempt for tradition, and the same resolution
to spurn the yoke, which, being first carried into philosophy
by Bacon, was afterwards carried into politics by
Cromwell; and which, during that very generation,
was enforced in theology by Chillingworth, Owen, and
Hales; in metaphysics by Hobbes and Glanvil; and in
the theory of government by Harrington, Sydney, and
Locke.</p>

<p>The progress which the English intellect was now
making towards shaking off ancient superstitions,<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
still further aided by the extraordinary zeal displayed
in the cultivation of the physical sciences. This, like
all great social movements, is clearly traceable to the
events by which it was preceded. It was partly cause,
and partly effect, of the increasing incredulity of the
age. The scepticism of the educated classes made
them dissatisfied with those long-established opinions,
which only rested on unsupported authority; and this
gave rise to a desire to ascertain how far such notions
might be verified or refuted by the real condition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
things. A curious instance of the rapid progress of
this spirit may be found in the works of an author who
was one of the most eminent among the mere literary
men of his time. While the Civil War was barely
decided, and three years before the execution of the
king, Sir Thomas Browne published his celebrated
work, called <i>Inquiries into Vulgar and Common Errors</i>.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
This able and learned production has the merit of
anticipating some of those results which more modern
inquirers have obtained;<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> but it is chiefly remarkable,
as being the first systematic and deliberate onslaught
ever made in England upon those superstitious fancies
which were then prevalent respecting the external
world. And what is still more interesting is, that the
circumstances under which it appeared make it evident,
that while the learning and genius of the author
belonged to himself, the scepticism which he displayed
respecting popular belief was forced on him by the
pressure of the age.</p>

<p>In or about 1633, when the throne was still occupied
by a superstitious prince; when the Church of England
was at the height of her apparent power; and when
men were incessantly persecuted for their religious
opinions&mdash;this same Sir Thomas Browne wrote his
<i>Religio Medici</i>,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> in which we find all the qualities of
his later work, except the scepticism. Indeed, in the
<i>Religio Medici</i>, there is shown a credulity that must
have secured the sympathy of those classes which were
then dominant. Of all the prejudices which at that
time were deemed an essential part of the popular
creed, there was not one which Browne ventured to
deny. He announces his belief in the philosopher's
stone;<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> in spirits, and tutelary angels;<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
palmistry.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> He not only peremptorily affirms the reality
of witches, but he says that those who deny their existence
are not merely infidels, but atheists.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> He carefully
tells us that he reckons his nativity, not from his
birth, but from his baptism; for before he was baptized,
he could not be said to exist.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> To these touches of
wisdom, he moreover adds, that the more improbable
any proposition is, the greater his willingness to assent
to it; but that when a thing is actually impossible, he
is on that very account prepared to believe it.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>Such were the opinions put forth by Sir Thomas
Browne in the first of the two great works he presented
to the world. But in his <i>Inquiries into Vulgar Errors</i>,
there is displayed a spirit so entirely different, that if
it were not for the most decisive evidence, we could
hardly believe it to be written by the same man. The
truth, however, is, that during the twelve years which
elapsed between the two works, there was completed
that vast social and intellectual revolution, of which
the overthrow of the church and the execution of the
king were but minor incidents. We know from the
literature, from the private correspondence, and from
the public acts of that time, how impossible it was,
even for the strongest minds, to escape the effects of
the general intoxication. No wonder, then, that
Browne, who certainly was inferior to several of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
contemporaries, should have been affected by a movement
which they were unable to resist. It would have
been strange, indeed, if he alone had remained uninfluenced
by that sceptical spirit, which, because it had
been arbitrarily repressed, had now broken all bounds,
and in the reaction soon swept away those institutions
which vainly attempted to stop its course.</p>

<p>It is in this point of view that a comparison of the
two works becomes highly interesting, and, indeed,
very important. In this, his later production, we hear
no more about believing things because they are impossible;
but we are told of &lsquo;the two great pillars of
truth, experience and solid reason.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> We are also
reminded that one main cause of error is &lsquo;adherence
unto authority;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> that another is, &lsquo;neglect of inquiry;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
and, strange to say, that a third is &lsquo;credulity.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>
All this was not very consistent with the old
theological spirit; and we need not, therefore, be surprised
that Browne not only exposes some of the innumerable
blunders of the Fathers,<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> but, after speaking
of errors in general, curtly adds: &lsquo;Many others there
are, which we resign unto divinity, and perhaps deserve
not controversy.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>The difference between these two works is no bad
measure of the rapidity of that vast movement which,
in the middle of the seventeenth century, was seen in
every branch of practical and speculative life. After
the death of Bacon, one of the most distinguished
Englishmen was certainly Boyle, who, if compared
with his contemporaries, may be said to rank immediately
below Newton, though, of course, very inferior to
him as an original thinker.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> With the additions he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
made to our knowledge we are not immediately concerned;
but it may be mentioned, that he was the first
who instituted exact experiments into the relation between
colour and heat;<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> and by this means, not only
ascertained some very important facts, but laid a foundation
for that union between optics and thermotics, which,
though not yet completed, now merely waits for some
great philosopher to strike out a generalization large
enough to cover both, and thus fuse the two sciences
into a single study. It is also to Boyle, more than to any
other Englishman, that we owe the science of hydrostatics,
in the state in which we now possess it.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> He
is the original discoverer of that beautiful law, so fertile
in valuable results, according to which the elasticity of
air varies as its density.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> And, in the opinion of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
of the most eminent modern naturalists, it was Boyle
who opened up those chemical inquiries, which went
on accumulating until, a century later, they supplied
the means by which Lavoisier and his contemporaries
fixed the real basis of chemistry, and enabled it for the
first time to take its proper stand among those sciences
that deal with the external world.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>The application of these discoveries to the happiness
of Man, and particularly to what may be called the
material interests of civilization, will be traced in
another part of this work; but what I now wish to
observe, is the way in which such investigations harmonized
with the movement I am attempting to describe.
In the whole of his physical inquiries, Boyle constantly
insists upon two fundamental principles: namely, the
importance of individual experiments, and the comparative
unimportance of the facts which, on these subjects,
antiquity has handed down.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> These are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
two great keys to his method: they are the views
which he inherited from Bacon, and they are also the
views which have been held by every man who, during
the last two centuries, has added anything of moment
to the stock of human knowledge. First to doubt,<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
then to inquire, and then to discover, has been the
process universally followed by our great teachers. So
strongly did Boyle feel this, that though he was an
eminently religious man,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> he gave to the most popular
of his scientific works the title of <i>The Sceptical Chemist</i>;
meaning to intimate, that until men were sceptical concerning
the chemistry of their own time, it would be
impossible that they should advance far in the career
which lay before them. Nor can we fail to observe
that this remarkable work, in which such havoc was
made with old notions, was published in 1661,<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> the
year after the accession of Charles II., in whose reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
the spread of incredulity was indeed rapid, since it was
seen not only among the intellectual classes, but even
among the nobles and personal friends of the king. It
is true, that in that rank of society, it assumed an
offensive and degenerate form. But the movement
must have been one of no common energy which, in
so early a stage, could thus penetrate the recesses of
the palace, and excite the minds of the courtiers; a lazy
and feeble race, who from the frivolity of their habits
are, under ordinary circumstances, predisposed to superstition,
and prepared to believe whatever the wisdom
of their fathers has bequeathed to them.</p>

<p>In everything this tendency was now seen. Everything
marked a growing determination to subordinate
old notions to new inquiries. At the very moment
when Boyle was prosecuting his labours, Charles II.
incorporated the Royal Society, which was formed with
the avowed object of increasing knowledge by direct
experiment.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> And it is well worthy of remark, that
the charter now first granted to this celebrated institution
declares that its object is the extension of natural
knowledge, as opposed to that which is supernatural.<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to imagine with what terror and disgust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
these things were viewed by those inordinate admirers
of antiquity who, solely occupied in venerating past
ages, are unable either to respect the present or hope
for the future. These great obstructors of mankind
played, in the seventeenth century, the same part as
they play in our own day, rejecting every novelty, and
therefore opposing every improvement. The angry
contest which arose between the two parties, and the
hostility directed against the Royal Society, as the first
institution in which the idea of progress was distinctly
embodied, are among the most instructive parts of our
history, and on another occasion I shall relate them at
considerable length. At present it is enough to say,
that the reactionary party, though led by an overwhelming
majority of the clergy, was entirely defeated;
as, indeed, was to be expected, seeing that their opponents
had on their side nearly all the intellect of the
country, and were moreover reinforced by such aid as
the court could bestow. The progress was, in truth,
so rapid as to carry away with it some of the ablest
members even of the ecclesiastical profession; their love
of knowledge proving too strong for the old traditions
in which they had been bred. But these were exceptional
cases, and, speaking generally, there is no doubt
that in the reign of Charles II. the antagonism between
physical science and the theological spirit was such as
to induce nearly the whole of the clergy to array themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
against the science, and seek to bring it into
discredit. Nor ought we to be surprised that they
should have adopted this course. That inquisitive and
experimental spirit which they wished to check was
not only offensive to their prejudices, but it was also
detrimental to their power. For, in the first place, the
mere habit of cultivating physical science taught men
to require a severity of proof which it was soon found
that the clergy were, in their own department, unable
to supply. And, in the second place, the additions made
to physical knowledge opened new fields of thought,
and thus tended still further to divert attention from
ecclesiastical topics. Both these effects would of
course be limited to the comparatively few persons
who were interested in scientific inquiries: it is, however,
to be observed, that the ultimate results of such
inquiries must have been extended over a far wider
surface. This may be called their secondary influence;
and the way in which it operated is well worth our
attention, because an acquaintance with it will go far
to explain the reason of that marked opposition which
has always existed between superstition and knowledge.</p>

<p>It is evident, that a nation perfectly ignorant of
physical laws will refer to supernatural causes all the
phenomena by which it is surrounded.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> But so soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
as natural science begins to do its work, there are
introduced the elements of a great change. Each successive
discovery, by ascertaining the law that governs
certain events, deprives them of that apparent mystery
in which they were formerly involved.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> The love of
the marvellous becomes proportionably diminished;
and when any science has made such progress as to
enable those who are acquainted with it to foretell the
events with which it deals, it is clear that the whole of
those events are at once withdrawn from the jurisdiction
of supernatural, and brought under the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
of natural powers.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> The business of physical philosophy
is, to explain external phenomena with a view to
their prediction; and every successful prediction which
is recognised by the people causes a disruption of one
of those links which, as it were, bind the imagination
to the occult and invisible world. Hence it is that,
supposing other things equal, the superstition of a
nation must always bear an exact proportion to the
extent of its physical knowledge. This may be in some
degree verified by the ordinary experience of mankind.
For if we compare the different classes of society, we
shall find that they are superstitious in proportion as
the phenomena with which they are brought in contact
have or have not been explained by natural laws. The
credulity of sailors is notorious, and every literature
contains evidence of the multiplicity of their superstitions,
and of the tenacity with which they cling to
them.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> This is perfectly explicable by the principle I
have laid down. Meteorology has not yet been raised
to a science; and the laws which regulate winds and
storms being in consequence still unknown, it naturally
follows, that the class of men most exposed to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
dangers should be precisely the class which is most
superstitious.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> On the other hand, soldiers live upon
an element much more obedient to man, and they are
less liable than sailors to those risks which defy the
calculations of science. Soldiers, therefore, have fewer
inducements to appeal to supernatural interference;
and it is universally observed, that as a body they are
less superstitious than sailors. If, again, we compare
agriculturists with manufacturers, we shall see the
operation of the same principle. To the cultivators of
land, one of the most important circumstances is the
weather, which, if it turn out unfavourable, may at once
defeat all their calculations. But science not having yet
succeeded in discovering the laws of rain, men are at
present unable to foretell it for any considerable period;
the inhabitant of the country is, therefore, driven to believe
that it is the result of supernatural agency, and we
still see the extraordinary spectacle of prayers offered up
in our churches for dry weather or for wet weather; a
superstition which to future ages will appear as childish
as the feelings of pious awe with which our fathers
regarded the presence of a comet, or the approach of
an eclipse. We are now acquainted with the laws
which determine the movements of comets and eclipses;
and as we are able to predict their appearance, we have
ceased to pray that we may be preserved from them.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
But because our researches into the phenomena of rain
happen to have been less successful,<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> we resort to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
impious contrivance of calling in the aid of the Deity
to supply those deficiencies in science which are the
result of our own sloth; and we are not ashamed, in
our public churches, to prostitute the rites of religion
by using them as a cloak to conceal an ignorance we
ought frankly to confess.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> The agriculturist is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
taught to ascribe to supernatural agency the most important
phenomena with which he is concerned;<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> and
there can be no doubt that this is one of the causes of
those superstitious feelings by which the inhabitants of
the country are unfavourably contrasted with those of
the town.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> But the manufacturer, and, indeed, nearly
every one engaged in the business of cities, has employments,
the success of which being regulated by his
own abilities, has no connexion with those unexplained
events that perplex the imagination of the cultivators
of the earth. He who, by his ingenuity, works up the
raw material, is evidently less affected by uncontrollable
occurrences, than he by whom the raw material
is originally grown. Whether it is fair, or whether it
is wet, he pursues his labours with equal success, and
learns to rely solely upon his own energy, and the
cunning of his own arm. As the sailor is naturally
more superstitious than the soldier, because he has to
deal with a more unstable element; just in the same
way is the agriculturist more superstitious than the
mechanic, because he is more frequently and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
seriously affected by events which the ignorance of some
men makes them call capricious, and the ignorance of
other men makes them call supernatural.</p>

<p>It would be easy, by an extension of these remarks,
to show how the progress of manufactures, besides
increasing the national wealth, has done immense
service to civilization, by inspiring Man with a confidence
in his own resources;<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> and how, by giving rise
to a new class of employments, it has, if I may so say,
shifted the scene in which superstition is most likely
to dwell. But to trace this would carry me beyond
my present limits; and the illustrations already given
are sufficient to explain how the theological spirit must
have been diminished by that love of experimental
science, which forms one of the principal features in
the reign of Charles II.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>I have now laid before the reader what I conceive to
be the point of view from which we ought to estimate
a period whose true nature seems to me to have been
grievously misunderstood. Those political writers who
judge events without regard to that intellectual development
of which they are but a part, will find much to
condemn, and scarcely anything to approve, in the
reign of Charles II. By such authors, I shall be censured
for having travelled out of that narrow path in
which history has been too often confined. And yet I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
am at a loss to perceive how it is possible, except by
the adoption of such a course, to understand a period
which, on a superficial view, is full of the grossest
inconsistencies. This difficulty will be rendered very
obvious, if we compare for a moment the nature of the
government of Charles with the great things which,
under that government, were peaceably effected. Never
before was there such a want of apparent connexion
between the means and the end. If we look only at
the characters of the rulers, and at their foreign policy,
we must pronounce the reign of Charles II. to be the
worst that has ever been seen in England. If, on the
other hand, we confine our observations to the laws
which were passed, and to the principles which were
established, we shall be obliged to confess that this
same reign forms one of the brightest epochs in our
national annals. Politically and morally, there were to
be found in the government all the elements of confusion,
of weakness, and of crime. The king himself
was a mean and spiritless voluptuary, without the
morals of a Christian, and almost without the feelings
of a man.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> His ministers, with the exception of
Clarendon, whom he hated for his virtues, had not one
of the attributes of statesmen, and nearly all of them
were pensioned by the crown of France.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> The weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
of taxation was increased,<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> while the security of the
kingdom was diminished.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> By the forced surrender
of the charters of the towns, our municipal rights were
endangered.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> By shutting the exchequer, our national
credit was destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Though immense sums were
spent in maintaining our naval and military power, we
were left so defenceless, that when a war broke out,
which had long been preparing, we seemed suddenly to
be taken by surprise. Such was the miserable incapacity
of the government, that the fleets of Holland were
able, not only to ride triumphant round our coasts, but
to sail up the Thames, attack our arsenals, burn our
ships, and insult the metropolis of England.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Yet,
notwithstanding all these things, it is an undoubted
fact, that in this same reign of Charles II. more steps
were taken in the right direction than had been taken,
in any period of equal length, during the twelve centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
we had occupied the soil of Britain. By the
mere force of that intellectual movement, which was
unwittingly supported by the crown, there were effected,
in the course of a few years, reforms which changed
the face of society.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> The two great obstacles by
which the nation had long been embarrassed, consisted
of a spiritual tyranny and a territorial tyranny: the
tyranny of the church and the tyranny of the nobles.
An attempt was now made to remedy these evils; not
by palliatives, but by striking at the power of the classes
who did the mischief. For now it was that a law was
placed on the statute-book, taking away that celebrated
writ, which enabled the bishops or their delegates to
cause those men to be burned whose religion was different
to their own.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Now it was that the clergy were
deprived of the privilege of taxing themselves, and
were forced to submit to an assessment made by the
ordinary legislature.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Now, too, there was enacted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
law forbidding any bishop, or any ecclesiastical court,
to tender the <i>ex-officio</i> oath, by which the church had
hitherto enjoyed the power of compelling a suspected
person to criminate himself.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> In regard to the nobles,
it was also during the reign of Charles II. that the
House of Lords, after a sharp struggle, was obliged to
abandon its pretensions to an original jurisdiction in
civil suits; and thus lost for ever an important resource
for extending its own influence.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> It was in the same
reign that there was settled the right of the people to
be taxed entirely by their representatives; the House
of Commons having ever since retained the sole power
of proposing money bills, and regulating the amount of
imposts, merely leaving to the Peers the form of consenting
to what has been already determined.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> These
were the attempts which were made to bridle the
clergy and the nobles. But there were also effected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
other things of equal importance. By the destruction
of the scandalous prerogatives of Purveyance and Preemption,
a limit was set to the power of the sovereign
to vex his refractory subjects.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> By the Habeas
Corpus Act, the liberty of every Englishman was made
as certain as law could make it; it being guaranteed
to him, that if accused of crime, he, instead of languishing
in prison, as had often been the case, should
be brought to a fair and speedy trial.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> By the Statute
of Frauds and Perjuries, a security hitherto unknown
was conferred upon private property.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
abolition of general impeachments, an end was put to a
great engine of tyranny, with which powerful and unscrupulous
men had frequently ruined their political
adversaries.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> By the cessation of those laws which
restricted the liberty of printing, there was laid the
foundation of that great Public Press, which, more
than any other single cause, has diffused among the
people a knowledge of their own power, and has thus,
to an almost incredible extent, aided the progress of
English civilization.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> And, to complete this noble
picture, there were finally destroyed those feudal incidents,
which our Norman conquerors had imposed,&mdash;the
military tenures; the court of wards; the fines for
alienation; the right of forfeiture for marriage by reason
of tenure; the aids, the homages, the escuages, the
primer seisins; and all those mischievous subtleties, of
which the mere names sound in modern ears as a wild
and barbarous jargon, but which pressed upon our ancestors
as real and serious evils.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p>These were the things which were done in the reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
of Charles II.; and if we consider the miserable incompetence
of the king, the idle profligacy of his court,
the unblushing venality of his ministers, the constant
conspiracies to which the country was exposed from
within, and the unprecedented insults to which it was
subjected from without; if we, moreover, consider that
to all this there were added two natural calamities of
the most grievous description,&mdash;a Great Plague, which
thinned society in all its ranks, and scattered confusion
through the kingdom, and a Great Fire, which, besides
increasing the mortality from the pestilence, destroyed
in a moment those accumulations of industry by which
industry itself is nourished;&mdash;if we put all these
things together, how can we reconcile inconsistencies
apparently so gross? How could so wonderful a progress
be made in the face of these unparalleled disasters?
How could such men, under such circumstances,
effect such improvements? These are questions which
our political compilers are unable to answer; because
they look too much at the peculiarities of individuals,
and too little at the temper of the age in which those
individuals live. Such writers do not perceive that
the history of every civilized country is the history of
its intellectual development, which kings, statesmen,
and legislators are more likely to retard than to hasten;
because, however great their power may be, they are
at best the accidental and insufficient representatives
of the spirit of their time; and because, so far from
being able to regulate the movements of the national
mind, they themselves form the smallest part of it,
and, in a general view of the progress of Man, are only
to be regarded as the puppets who strut and fret their
hour upon a little stage; while, beyond them, and on
every side of them, are forming opinions and principles
which they can scarcely perceive, but by which alone
the whole course of human affairs is ultimately
governed.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the vast legislative reforms, for
which the reign of Charles II. is so remarkable, merely
form a part of that movement, which, though traceable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
to a much earlier period, had only for three generations
been in undisguised operation. These important
improvements were the result of that bold, sceptical,
inquiring, and reforming spirit, which had now seized
the three great departments of Theology, of Science,
and of Politics. The old principles of tradition, of
authority, and of dogma, were gradually becoming
weaker; and of course, in the same proportion, there
was diminished the influence of the classes by whom
those principles were chiefly upheld. As the power of
particular sections of society thus declined, the power
of the people at large increased. The real interests of
the nation began to be perceived, so soon as the superstitions
were dispersed by which those interests had
long been obscured. This, I believe, is the real solution
of what at first seems a curious problem,&mdash;namely,
how it was that such comprehensive reforms should
have been accomplished in so bad, and in many
respects so infamous, a reign. It is, no doubt, true,
that those reforms were essentially the result of the
intellectual march of the age; but, so far from being
made in spite of the vices of the sovereign, they were
actually aided by them. With the exception of the
needy profligates who thronged his court, all classes of
men soon learned to despise a king who was a drunkard,
a libertine, and a hypocrite; who had neither
shame nor sensibility; and who, in point of honour,
was unworthy to enter the presence of the meanest of
his subjects. To have the throne filled for a quarter
of a century by such a man as this, was the surest way
of weakening that ignorant and indiscriminate loyalty,
to which the people have often sacrificed their dearest
rights. Thus, the character of the king, merely considered
from this point of view, was eminently favourable
to the growth of national liberty.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
advantage did not stop there. The reckless debaucheries
of Charles made him abhor everything approaching to
restraint; and this gave him a dislike to a class, whose
profession, at least, pre-supposes a conduct of more
than ordinary purity. The consequence was, that he,
not from views of enlightened policy, but merely from
a love of vicious indulgence, always had a distaste for
the clergy; and, so far from advancing their power,
frequently expressed for them an open contempt.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
His most intimate friends directed against them those
coarse and profligate jokes which are preserved in the
literature of the time; and which, in the opinion of
the courtiers, were to be ranked among the noblest
specimens of human wit. From men of this sort the
church had, indeed, little to apprehend; but their language,
and the favour with which it was received, are
part of the symptoms by which we may study the temper
of that age. Many other illustrations will occur to most
readers; I may, however, mention one, which is interesting
on account of the eminence of the philosopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
concerned in it. The most dangerous opponent of
the clergy in the seventeenth century, was certainly
Hobbes, the subtlest dialectician of his time; a writer,
too, of singular clearness, and, among British metaphysicians,
inferior only to Berkeley. This profound
thinker published several speculations very unfavourable
to the church, and directly opposed to principles
which are essential to ecclesiastical authority. As a
natural consequence, he was hated by the clergy; his
doctrines were declared to be highly pernicious; and
he was accused of wishing to subvert the national
religion, and corrupt the national morals.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> So far did
this proceed, that, during his life, and for several years
after his death, every man who ventured to think for
himself was stigmatized as a Hobbist, or, as it was
sometimes called, a Hobbian.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> This marked hostility
on the part of the clergy was a sufficient recommendation
to the favour of Charles. The king, even before
his accession, had imbibed many of his principles;<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and, after the Restoration, he treated the author with
what was deemed a scandalous respect. He protected
him from his enemies; he somewhat ostentatiously
hung up his portrait in his own private room
at Whitehall;<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and he even conferred a pension on
this, the most formidable opponent who had yet appeared
against the spiritual hierarchy.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>If we look for a moment at the ecclesiastical appointments
of Charles, we shall find evidence of the same
tendency. In his reign, the highest dignities in the
church were invariably conferred upon men who were
deficient either in ability or in honesty. It would perhaps
be an over-refinement to ascribe to the king a
deliberate plan for lowering the reputation of the episcopal
bench; but it is certain, that if he had such a
plan, he followed the course most likely to effect his
purpose. For it is no exaggeration to say, that, during
his life, the leading English prelates were, without
exception, either incapable or insincere; they were
unable to defend what they really believed, or else they
did not believe what they openly professed. Never before
were the interests of the Anglican church so feebly
guarded. The first Archbishop of Canterbury appointed
by Charles was Juxon, whose deficiencies were
notorious; and of whom his friends could only say,
that his want of ability was compensated by the goodness
of his intentions.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> When he died, the king raised
up as his successor Sheldon, whom he had previously
made Bishop of London; and who not only brought
discredit on his order by acts of gross intolerance,<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
but who was so regardless of the common decencies
of his station, that he used to amuse his associates, by
having exhibitions in his own house, imitating the way
in which the Presbyterians delivered their sermons.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
After the death of Sheldon, Charles appointed to the archbishopric
Sancroft; whose superstitious fancies exposed
him to the contempt even of his own profession, and
who was as much despised as Sheldon had been hated.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
In the rank immediately below this, we find the same
principle at work. The three Archbishops of York,
during the reign of Charles II., were Frewen, Stearn,
and Dolben; who were so utterly devoid of ability, that
notwithstanding their elevated position, they are altogether
forgotten, not one reader out of a thousand
having ever heard their names.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>Such appointments as these are indeed striking; and
what makes them more so, is, that they were by no
means necessary; they were not forced on the king by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
court intrigue, nor was there a lack of more competent
men. The truth seems to be, that Charles was unwilling
to confer ecclesiastical promotion upon any one who
had ability enough to increase the authority of the
church, and restore it to its former pre-eminence. At
his accession, the two ablest of the clergy were undoubtedly
Jeremy Taylor and Isaac Barrow. Both of
them were notorious for their loyalty; both of them
were men of unspotted virtue; and both of them have
left a reputation which will hardly perish while the
English language is remembered. But Taylor, though
he had married the king's sister,<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> was treated with
marked neglect; and, being exiled to an Irish bishopric,
had to pass the remainder of his life in what, at that
time, was truly called a barbarous country.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> As to
Barrow, who, in point of genius, was probably superior
to Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> he had the mortification of seeing the
most incapable men raised to the highest posts in the
church, while he himself was unnoticed; and, notwithstanding
that his family had greatly suffered in the
royal cause,<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> he received no sort of preferment until
five years before his death, when the king conferred on
him the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to point out how all this must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
have tended to weaken the church, and accelerate that
great movement for which the reign of Charles II. is
remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> At the same time, there were many
other circumstances which, in this preliminary sketch,
it is impossible to notice, but which were stamped with
the general character of revolt against ancient authority.
In a subsequent volume, this will be placed in a still
clearer light, because I shall have an opportunity of
bringing forward evidence which, from the abundance
of its details, would be unsuited to the present Introduction.
Enough, however, has been stated, to indicate
the general march of the English mind, and supply the
reader with a clue by which he may understand those
still more complicated events, which, as the seventeenth
century advanced, began to thicken upon us.</p>

<p>A few years before the death of Charles II., the
clergy made a great effort to recover their former
power by reviving those doctrines of Passive Obedience
and Divine Right, which are obviously favourable to
the progress of superstition.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> But as the English intellect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
was now sufficiently advanced to reject such
dogmas, this futile attempt only increased the opposition
between the interests of the people as a body, and
the interests of the clergy as a class. Scarcely had
this scheme been defeated, when the sudden death of
Charles placed on the throne a prince whose most earnest
desire was to restore the Catholic church, and reinstate
among us that mischievous system which openly
boasts of subjugating the reason of Man. This change
in affairs was, if we consider it in its ultimate results,
the most fortunate circumstance which could have
happened to our country. In spite of the difference of
their religion, the English clergy had always displayed
an affection towards James, whose reverence for the
priesthood they greatly admired; though they were
anxious that the warmth of his affections should be
lavished on the Church of England and not on the Church
of Rome. They were sensible of the advantages which
would accrue to their own order, if his piety could be
turned into a new channel.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> They saw that it was for
his interest to abandon his religion; and they thought
that to a man so cruel and so vicious, his own interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
would be the sole consideration.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> The consequence
was, that in one of the most critical moments of his
life, they made in his favour a great and successful
effort; and they not only used all their strength to
defeat the bill by which it was proposed to exclude him
from the succession, but when the measure was rejected,
they presented an address to Charles, congratulating
him on the result.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> When James actually
mounted the throne, they continued to display the
same spirit. Whether they still hoped for his conversion,
or whether, in their eagerness to persecute the
dissenters, they overlooked the danger to their own
church, is uncertain; but it is one of the most singular
and unquestionable facts in our history, that for some
time there existed a strict alliance between a Protestant
hierarchy and a Popish king.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> The terrible crimes
which were the result of this compact are but too
notorious. But what is more worthy of attention is,
the circumstance that caused the dissolution of this
conspiracy between the crown and the church. The
ground of the quarrel was an attempt made by the king
to effect, in some degree, a religious toleration. By
the celebrated Test and Corporation Acts, it had been
ordered, that all persons who were employed by government
should be compelled, under a heavy penalty, to
receive the sacrament according to the rites of the
English church. The offence of James was, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
now issued what was called a Declaration of Indulgence,
in which he announced his intention of suspending the
execution of these laws.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> From this moment, the position
of the two great parties was entirely changed.
The bishops clearly perceived that the statutes which
it was thus attempted to abrogate, were highly favourable
to their own power; and hence, in their opinion,
formed an essential part of the constitution of a Christian
country. They had willingly combined with
James, while he assisted them in persecuting men who
worshipped God in a manner different from themselves.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
So long as this compact held good, they were
indifferent as to matters which they considered to be
of minor importance. They looked on in silence, while
the king was amassing the materials with which he
hoped to turn a free government into an absolute monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>
They saw Jeffreys and Kirke torturing their
fellow-subjects; they saw the gaols crowded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
prisoners, and the scaffold streaming with blood.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>
They were well pleased that some of the best and ablest
men in the kingdom should be barbarously persecuted;
that Baxter should be thrown into prison, and that
Howe should be forced into exile. They witnessed
with composure the most revolting cruelties, because
the victims of them were the opponents of the English
church. Although the minds of men were filled with
terror and with loathing, the bishops made no complaint.
They preserved their loyalty unimpaired, and
insisted on the necessity of humble submission to the
Lord's anointed.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> But the moment James proposed
to protect against persecution those who were hostile
to the church; the moment he announced his intention
of breaking down that monopoly of offices and of
honours which the bishops had long secured for their
own party;&mdash;the moment this took place, the hierarchy
became alive to the dangers with which the country
was threatened from the violence of so arbitrary a
prince.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> The king had laid his hand on the ark, and
the guardians of the temple flew to arms. How could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
they tolerate a prince who would not allow them to
persecute their enemies? How could they support a
sovereign who sought to favour those who differed from
the national church? They soon determined on the
line of conduct it behoved them to take. With an
almost unanimous voice, they refused to obey the order
by which the king commanded them to read in their
churches the edict for religious toleration.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> Nor did
they stop there. So great was their enmity against
him they had recently cherished, that they actually
applied for aid to those very dissenters whom, only a
few weeks before, they had hotly persecuted; seeking
by magnificent promises to win over to their
side men they had hitherto hunted even to the
death.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> The most eminent of the Nonconformists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
were far from being duped by this sudden affection.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>
But their hatred of Popery, and their fear of the ulterior
designs of the king, prevailed over every other
consideration; and there arose that singular combination
between churchmen and dissenters, which has
never since been repeated. This coalition, backed by
the general voice of the people, soon overturned the
throne, and gave rise to what is justly deemed one of
the most important events in the history of England.</p>

<p>Thus it was, that the proximate cause of that great
revolution which cost James his crown, was the publication
by the king of an edict of religious toleration, and
the consequent indignation of the clergy at seeing so
audacious an act performed by a Christian prince. It
is true, that if other things had not conspired, this
alone could never have effected so great a change. But
it was the immediate cause of it, because it was the
cause of the schism between the church and the throne,
and of the alliance between the church and the dissenters.
This is a fact never to be forgotten. We
ought never to forget, that the first and only time the
Church of England has made war upon the crown, was
when the crown had declared its intention of tolerating,
and in some degree protecting, the rival religions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
country.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> There is no doubt that the Declaration
which was then issued was illegal, and that it was conceived
in an insidious spirit. But declarations equally
illegal, equally insidious, and much more tyrannical, had
on other occasions been made by the sovereign, without
exciting the anger of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> These are things
which it is good for us to ponder. These are lessons
of inestimable value for those to whom it is given, not,
indeed, to direct, but in some degree to modify, the
march of public opinion. As to the people in general,
it is impossible for them to exaggerate the obligations
which they and all of us owe to the Revolution of 1688.
But let them take heed that superstition does not
mingle with their gratitude. Let them admire that
majestic edifice of national liberty, which stands alone
in Europe like a beacon in the midst of the waters; but
let them not think that they owe anything to men
who, in contributing to its erection, sought the gratification
of their own selfishness, and the consolidation
of that spiritual power which by it they fondly hoped
to secure.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, difficult to conceive the full amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
the impetus given to English civilization by the expulsion
of the House of Stuart. Among the most immediate results,
may be mentioned the limits that were set to the
royal prerogative;<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> the important steps that were
taken towards religious toleration;<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> the remarkable
and permanent improvement in the administration of
justice;<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> the final abolition of a censorship over the
press;<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> and, what has not excited sufficient attention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the rapid growth, of those great monetary interests by
which, as we shall hereafter see, the prejudices of the
superstitious classes have in no small degree been
counterbalanced.<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> These are the main characteristics
of the reign of William III.; a reign often aspersed,
and little understood,<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> but of which it may be truly
said, that, taking its difficulties into due consideration,
it is the most successful and the most splendid recorded
in the history of any country. But these topics rather
belong to the subsequent volumes of this work; and at
present we are only concerned in tracing the effects of
the Revolution upon that ecclesiastical power by which
it was immediately brought about.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the clergy succeeded in expelling
James, when the greater number of them repented of
their own act.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> Indeed, even before he was driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
from the country, several things had occurred to make
them doubt the policy of the course they were pursuing.
During the last few weeks that he was allowed to reign,
he had shown symptoms of increasing respect for the
English hierarchy. The archbishopric of York had
so long been vacant, as to cause a belief that it was the
intention of the crown either to appoint to it a Catholic,
or else to seize its revenues.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> But James, to the
delight of the church, now filled up this important office
by nominating Lamplugh, who was well known to be a
stanch churchman and a zealous defender of episcopal
privileges.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Just before this, the king also rescinded
the order by which the Bishop of London had been
suspended from the exercise of his functions.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> To
the bishops in general he made great promises of future
favour;<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> some of them, it was said, were to be called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
to his privy council; and, in the meantime, he cancelled
that ecclesiastical commission which, by limiting their
power, had excited their anger.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Besides this, there
occurred some other circumstances which the clergy now
had to consider. It was rumoured, and it was generally
believed, that William was no great admirer of ecclesiastical
establishments; and that, being a friend to
toleration, he was more likely to diminish the power
than increase the privileges of the English hierarchy.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>
It was also known that he favoured the Presbyterians,
whom the Church not unreasonably regarded as her
bitterest enemies.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> And when, in addition to all this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
William, on mere grounds of expediency, actually
abolished episcopacy in Scotland, it became evident
that, by thus repudiating the doctrine of divine right,
he had directed a great blow against those opinions
on which, in England, ecclesiastical authority was
based.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>While these things were agitating the public mind,
the eyes of men were naturally turned upon the bishops,
who, though they had lost much of their former power,
were still respected by a large majority of the people
as the guardians of the national religion. But at this
critical moment they were so blinded, either by their
ambition or by their prejudices, that they adopted a
course which of all others was the most injurious to their
reputation. They made a sudden attempt to reverse that
political movement of which they were themselves the
principal originators. Their conduct on this occasion
amply confirms that account of their motives which I
have already given. If, in aiding those preliminary
measures by which the Revolution was effected, they had
been moved by a desire of relieving the nation from
despotism, they would have eagerly welcomed that great
man at whose approach the despot took to flight. This
is what the clergy would have done, if they had loved
their country better than they loved their order. But
they pursued a precisely opposite course; because they
preferred the petty interests of their own class to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
welfare of the great body of the people, and because
they would rather that the country should be oppressed
than that the church should be humbled. Nearly
the whole of the bishops and clergy had, only a
few weeks before, braved the anger of their sovereign
sooner than read in their churches an edict for religious
toleration, and seven of the most influential of the episcopal
order had, in the same cause, willingly submitted
to the risk of a public trial before the ordinary tribunals
of the land. This bold course they professed to have
adopted, not because they disliked toleration, but
because they hated tyranny. And yet when William
arrived in England, and when James stole away from
the kingdom like a thief in the night, this same ecclesiastical
profession pressed forward to reject that great
man, who, without striking a blow, had by his mere
presence saved the country from the slavery with which
it was threatened. We shall not easily find in modern
history another instance of such gross inconsistency, or
rather, let us say, of such selfish and reckless ambition.
For this change of plan, far from being concealed, was
so openly displayed, and the causes of it were so obvious,
that the scandal was laid bare before the whole country.
Within the space of a few weeks the apostasy was consummated.
The first in the field was the Archbishop
of Canterbury, who, anxious to retain his office, had
promised to wait upon William. But when he saw the
direction things were likely to take, he withdrew his
promise, and would not recognize a prince who showed
such indifference to the sacred order.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Indeed, so
great was his anger, that he sharply rebuked his
chaplain for presuming to pray for William and Mary,
although they had been proclaimed with the full consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
of the nation, and although the crown had been delivered
to them by the solemn and deliberate act of a public
convention of the estates of the realm.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> While such
was the conduct of the primate of England, his brethren
were not wanting to him in this great emergency of
their common fate. The oath of allegiance was refused
not only by the Archbishop of Canterbury, but also by
the Bishop of Bath and Wells, by the Bishop of Chester,
by the Bishop of Chichester, by the Bishop of Ely, by the
Bishop of Gloucester, by the Bishop of Norwich, by the
Bishop of Peterborough, and by the Bishop of Worcester.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>
As to the inferior clergy, our information is
less precise; but it is said that about six hundred of
them imitated their superiors in declining to recognize
for their king him whom the country had elected.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
The other members of this turbulent faction were
unwilling, by so bold a measure, to incur that deprivation
of their livings with which William would probably
have visited them. They, therefore, preferred a safer
and more inglorious opposition, by which they could
embarrass the government without injuring themselves,
and could gain the reputation of orthodoxy without
incurring the pains of martyrdom.</p>

<p>The effect which all this produced on the temper of
the nation may be easily imagined. The question was
now narrowed to an issue which every plain man could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
at once understand. On the one side, there was an
overwhelming majority of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> On the other
side there was all the intellect of England, and all her
dearest interests. The mere fact that such an opposition
could exist without kindling a civil war, showed
how the growing intelligence of the people had weakened
the authority of the ecclesiastical profession. Besides
this, the opposition was not only futile, but it was
also injurious to the class that made it.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> For it was
now seen that the clergy only cared for the people as
long as the people cared for them. The violence with
which these angry men<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> set themselves against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
interests of the nation clearly proved the selfishness of
that zeal against James, of which they had formerly
made so great a merit. They continued to hope for his
return, to intrigue for him, and in some instances to
correspond with him; although they well knew that
his presence would cause a civil war, and that he was
so generally hated that he dared not show his face in
England unless protected by the troops of a foreign and
hostile power.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>But this was not the whole of the damage which, in
those anxious times, the church inflicted upon herself.
When the bishops refused to take the oaths to the new
government, measures were adopted to remove them
from their sees; and William did not hesitate to eject
by force of law the Archbishop of Canterbury and five
of his brethren.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> The prelates, smarting under the
insult, were goaded into measures of unusual activity.
They loudly proclaimed that the powers of the church,
which had long been waning, were now extinct.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
They denied the right of the legislature to pass a law
against them. They denied the right of the sovereign
to put that law into execution.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> They not only continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
to give themselves the title of bishops, but they
made arrangements to perpetuate the schism which
their own violence had created. The Archbishop of
Canterbury, as he insisted upon being called, made a
formal renunciation of his imaginary right into the
hands of Lloyd,<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> who still supposed himself to be
Bishop of Norwich, although William had recently
expelled him from his see. The scheme of these turbulent
priests was then communicated to James, who
willingly supported their plan for establishing a permanent
feud in the English church.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> The result of
this conspiracy between the rebellious prelates and the
pretended king, was the appointment of a series of men
who gave themselves out as forming the real episcopacy,
and who received the homage of every one who
preferred the claims of the church to the authority of
the state.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> This mock succession of imaginary bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
continued for more than a century;<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> and, by dividing
the allegiance of churchmen, lessened the power of the
church.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> In several instances, the unseemly spectacle
was exhibited of two bishops for the same place; one
nominated by the spiritual power, the other nominated
by the temporal power. Those who considered the
church as superior to the state, of course attached
themselves to the spurious bishops; while the appointments
of William were acknowledged by that rapidly
increasing party, who preferred secular advantages to
ecclesiastical theories.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>Such were some of the events which, at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
the seventeenth century, widened the breach that had
long existed between the interests of the nation and
the interests of the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> There was also another
circumstance which considerably increased this alienation.
Many of the English clergy, though they retained
their affection for James, did not choose to brave the
anger of the government, or risk the loss of their
livings. To avoid this, and to reconcile their conscience
with their interest, they availed themselves of
a supposed distinction between a king by right and a
king in possession.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> The consequence was, that while
with their lips they took an oath of allegiance to
William, they in their hearts paid homage to James;
and, while they prayed for one king in their churches,
they were bound to pray for another in their closets.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
By this wretched subterfuge, a large body of the clergy
were at once turned into concealed rebels; and we
have it on the authority of a contemporary bishop, that
the prevarication of which these men were notoriously
guilty was a still further aid to that scepticism, the
progress of which he bitterly deplores.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>As the eighteenth century advanced, the great movement
of liberation rapidly proceeded. One of the most
important of the ecclesiastical resources had formerly
been Convocation; in which the clergy, by meeting in
a body, were able to discountenance in an imposing
manner whatever might be hostile to the church; and
had, moreover, an opportunity, which they sedulously
employed, of devising schemes favourable to the spiritual
authority.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> But, in the progress of the age,
this weapon also was taken from them. Within a very
few years after the Revolution, Convocation fell into
general contempt;<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> and, in 1717, this celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
assembly was finally prorogued by an act of the crown,
it being justly considered that the country had no further
occasion for its services.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> Since that period,
this great council of the English church has never been
allowed to meet for the purpose of deliberating on
its own affairs, until a few years ago, when, by the
connivance of a feeble government, it was permitted to
reassemble. So marked, however, has been the change
in the temper of the nation, that this once formidable
body does not now retain even a semblance of its
ancient influence; its resolutions are no longer feared,
its discussions are no longer studied; and the business
of the country continues to be conducted without regard
to those interests which, only a few generations ago,
were considered by every statesman to be of supreme
importance.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, immediately after the Revolution, the tendency
of things became too obvious to be mistaken, even
by the most superficial observers. The ablest men in
the country no longer flocked into the church, but preferred
those secular professions in which ability was
more likely to be rewarded.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> At the same time, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
as a natural part of the great movement, the clergy
saw all the offices of power and emolument, which they
had been used to hold, gradually falling out of their
hands. Not only in the dark ages, but even so late as
the fifteenth century, they were still strong enough to
monopolize the most honourable and lucrative posts in
the empire.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> In the sixteenth century, the tide began
to turn against them, and advanced with such steadiness,
that, since the seventeenth century, there has
been no instance of any ecclesiastic being made lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
chancellor;<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> and, since the beginning of the eighteenth
century, there has been no instance of one receiving
any diplomatic appointment, or, indeed, holding any
important office in the state.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> Nor has this increasing
ascendency of laymen been confined to the executive
government. On the contrary, we find in both Houses
of Parliament the same principle at work. In the early
and barbarous periods of our history, one half of the
House of Lords consisted of temporal peers; the other
half of spiritual ones.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> By the beginning of the
eighteenth century, the spiritual peers, instead of forming
one-half of the upper house, had dwindled away to
one-eighth;<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> and, in the middle of the nineteenth
century, they have still further shrunk to one-fourteenth:<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
thus supplying a striking numerical instance
of that diminution of ecclesiastical power which is an
essential requisite of modern civilization. Precisely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
the same way, more than fifty years have elapsed since
any clergyman has been able to take his seat as a representative
of the people; the House of Commons
having, in 1801, formally closed their doors against a
profession which, in the olden time, would have been
gladly admitted, even by the proudest and most exclusive
assembly.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> In the House of Lords, the bishops
still retain their seats; but their precarious tenure is
everywhere remarked, and the progress of public
opinion is constantly pointing to a period, which cannot
now be far distant, when the Peers will imitate the
example set by the Commons, and will induce the
legislature to relieve the upper house of its spiritual
members; since they, by their habits, their tastes, and
their traditions, are evidently unfitted for the profane
exigencies of political life.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>While the fabric of superstition was thus tottering
from internal decay, and while that ecclesiastical authority
which had formerly played so great a part was
gradually yielding to the advance of knowledge, there
suddenly occurred an event which, though it might
naturally have been expected, evidently took by surprise
even those whom it most interested. I allude, of
course, to that great religious revolution, which was a
fitting supplement to the political revolution which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
preceded it. The dissenters, who were strengthened
by the expulsion of James, had by no means forgotten
those cruel punishments which the Church of England,
in the days of her power, had constantly inflicted upon
them; and they felt that the moment had now come
when they could assume towards her a bolder front
than that on which they had hitherto ventured.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
Besides this, they had in the mean time received fresh
causes of provocation. After the death of our great
king William III., the throne was occupied by a foolish
and ignorant woman, whose love for the clergy would,
in a more superstitious age, have led to dangerous
results.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> Even as it was, a temporary reaction took
place, and during her reign the church was treated with
a deference which William had disdained to show.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
natural consequence immediately followed. New measures
of persecution were devised, and fresh laws were
passed against those Protestants who did not conform
to the doctrines and discipline of the English church.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
But after the death of Anne the dissenters quickly
rallied; their hopes revived,<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> their numbers continued
to increase, and in spite of the opposition of the clergy,
the laws against them were repealed.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> As by these
means they were placed more on a level with their
opponents, and as their temper was soured by the injuries
they had recently received, it was clear that a
great struggle between the two parties was inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
For by this time the protracted tyranny of the English
clergy had totally destroyed those feelings of respect
which, even in the midst of hostility, often linger in
the mind; and by the influence of which, if they had
still existed, the contest might perhaps have been
averted. But such motives of restraint were now despised;
and the dissenters, exasperated by incessant
persecution,<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> determined to avail themselves of the
declining power of the church. They had resisted her
when she was strong; it was hardly to be expected
that they would spare her when she was feeble. Under
two of the most remarkable men of the eighteenth century,
Whitefield, the first of theological orators,<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> and
Wesley, the first of theological statesmen,<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
organized a great system of religion, which bore the
same relation to the Church of England that the Church
of England bore to the Church of Rome. Thus, after
an interval of two hundred years, a second spiritual
Reformation was effected in our country. In the
eighteenth century the Wesleyans were to the Bishops
what, in the sixteenth century, the Reformers were to
the Popes.<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> It is indeed true, that the dissenters from
the Church of England, unlike the dissenters from the
Church of Rome, soon lost that intellectual vigour for
which at first they were remarkable. Since the death
of their great leaders, they have not produced one man
of original genius; and since the time of Adam Clarke,
they have not had among them even a single scholar
who has enjoyed an European reputation. This mental
penury is perhaps owing, not to any circumstances
peculiar to their sect, but merely to that general decline
of the theological spirit, by which their adversaries have
been weakened as well as themselves.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> Be this as it
may, it is at all events certain, that the injury they have
inflicted on the English church is far greater than is
generally supposed, and, I am inclined to think, is
hardly inferior to that which in the sixteenth century
Protestantism inflicted upon Popery. Setting aside the
actual loss in the number of its members,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> there can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
be no doubt that the mere formation of a Protestant
faction, unopposed by the government, was a dangerous
precedent; and we know from contemporary history
that it was so considered by those who were most interested
in the result.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Besides this, the Wesleyans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
displayed an organization so superior to that of their
predecessors the Puritans, that they soon became a
centre round which the enemies of the church could
conveniently rally. And, what is perhaps still more
important, the order, regularity, and publicity, by which
their proceedings have usually been marked, distinguished
them from other sects; and by raising them
as it were to the dignity of a rival establishment, have
encouraged the diminution of that exclusive and superstitious
respect which was once paid to the Anglican
hierarchy.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>But these things, interesting as they are, only formed
a single step of that vast process by which the ecclesiastical
power was weakened, and our countrymen thus
enabled to secure a religious liberty, imperfect indeed,
but far superior to that possessed by any other people.
Among the innumerable symptoms of this great movement,
there were two of peculiar importance. These
were, the separation of theology, first from morals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
then from politics. The separation from morals was
effected late in the seventeenth century; the separation
from politics before the middle of the eighteenth century.
And it is a striking instance of the decline of
the old ecclesiastical spirit, that both of these great
changes were begun by the clergy themselves. Cumberland,
bishop of Peterborough, was the first who
endeavoured to construct a system of morals without
the aid of theology.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> Warburton, bishop of Gloucester,
was the first who laid down that the state must consider
religion in reference, not to revelation, but to
expediency; and that it should favour any particular
creed, not in proportion to its truth, but solely with a
view to its general utility.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> Nor were these mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
barren principles, which subsequent inquirers were
unable to apply. The opinions of Cumberland, pushed
to their furthest extent by Hume,<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> were shortly
afterwards applied to practical conduct by Paley,<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> and
to speculative jurisprudence by Bentham and Mill;<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
while the opinions of Warburton, spreading with still
greater rapidity, have influenced our legislative policy,
and are now professed, not only by advanced thinkers,
but even by those ordinary men, who, if they had
lived fifty years earlier, would have shrunk from them
with unassembled fear.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was that, in England, theology was finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
severed from the two great departments of ethics and
of government. As, however, this important change
was at first not of a practical, but solely of an intellectual
character, its operation was, for many years,
confined to a small class, and has not yet produced the
whole of those results which we have every reason to
anticipate. But there were other circumstances which
tended in the same direction, and which, being known
to all men of tolerable education, produced effects more
immediate, though perhaps less permanent. To trace
their details, and point out the connexion between them,
will be the business of part of the future volumes of this
work: at present, I can only glance at the leading
features. Of these, the most prominent were: The
great Arian controversy, which, rashly instigated by
Whiston, Clarke, and Waterland, disseminated doubts
among nearly all classes;<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> the Bangorian controversy,
which, involving matters of ecclesiastical discipline
hitherto untouched, led to discussions dangerous to
the power of the church;<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> the great work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
Blackburne on the Confessional, which at one moment
almost caused a schism in the Establishment itself;<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>
the celebrated dispute respecting miracles between
Middleton, Church, and Dodwell, continued, with still
larger views, by Hume, Campbell, and Douglas; <a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> the
exposure of the gross absurdities of the Fathers, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
already begun by Daillé and Barbeyrac, was followed
up by Cave, Middleton, and Jortin; the important and
unrefuted statements of Gibbon, in his fifteenth and
sixteenth chapters; the additional strength conferred
on those chapters by the lame attacks of Davis, Chelsum,
Whitaker, and Watson;<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> while, not to mention
inferior matters, the century was closed amid the confusion
caused by that decisive controversy between
Porson and Travis, respecting the text of the Heavenly
Witnesses, which excited immense attention,<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> and was
immediately accompanied by the discoveries of geologists,
in which, not only was the fidelity of the Mosaic
cosmogony impugned, but its accuracy was shown to
be impossible.<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> These things, following each other in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
rapid and startling succession, perplexed the faith of
men, disturbed their easy credulity, and produced effects
on the public mind, which can only be estimated by
those who have studied the history of that time in its
original sources. Indeed, they cannot be understood,
even in their general bearings, except by taking into
consideration some other circumstances with which the
great progress was intimately connected.</p>

<p>For, in the mean time, an immense change had begun,
not only among speculative minds, but also among the
people themselves. The increase of scepticism stimulated
their curiosity; and the diffusion of education
supplied the means of gratifying it. Hence, we find
that one of the leading characteristics of the eighteenth
century, and one which pre-eminently distinguished it
from all that preceded, was a craving after knowledge
on the part of those classes from whom knowledge had
hitherto been shut out. It was in that great age, that
there were first established schools for the lower orders
on the only day they had time to attend them,<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
newspapers on the only day they had time to read
them.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> It was then that there were first seen, in our
country, circulating libraries;<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> and it was then, too,
that the art of printing, instead of being almost confined
to London, began to be generally practised in
country-towns.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> It was also in the eighteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
that the earliest systematic efforts were made to
popularize the sciences, and facilitate the acquisition of
their general principles, by writing treatises on them in
an easy and untechnical style:<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> while, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
time, the invention of Encyclopædias enabled their
results to be brought together, and digested in a form
more accessible than any hitherto employed.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Then,
too, we first meet with literary periodical reviews; by
means of which large bodies of practical men acquired
information, scanty indeed, but every way superior to
their former ignorance.<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> The formation of societies
for purchasing books now became general;<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> and,
before the close of the century, we hear of clubs instituted
by reading men among the industrious classes.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
In every department, the same eager curiosity was
shown. In the middle of the eighteenth century, debating
societies sprung up among tradesmen;<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
this was followed by a still bolder innovation, for, in
1769, there was held the first public meeting ever
assembled in England, the first in which it was attempted
to enlighten Englishmen respecting their political
rights.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> About the same time, the proceedings
in our courts of law began to be studied by the people,
and communicated to them through the medium of the
daily press.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> Shortly before this, political newspapers
arose,<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> and a sharp struggle broke out between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
and the two Houses of Parliament touching the right
of publishing the debates; the end of which was, that
both houses, though aided by the crown, were totally
defeated; and, for the first time, the people were able
to study the proceedings of the national legislature, and
thus gain some acquaintance with the national affairs.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>
Scarcely was this triumph completed, when fresh stimulus
was given by the promulgation of that great
political doctrine of personal representation,<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> which
must eventually carry all before it; and the germ of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
which may be traced late in the seventeenth century,
when the true idea of personal independence began to
take root and flourish.<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> Finally, it was reserved for
the eighteenth century to set the first example of
calling on the people to adjudicate upon those solemn
questions of religion in which hitherto they had never
been consulted, although it is now universally admitted
that to their growing intelligence these, and all other
matters, must ultimately be referred.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p>In connexion with all this, there was a corresponding
change in the very form and make of our literature.
The harsh and pedantic method, which our great writers
had long been accustomed to employ, was ill suited to
an impetuous and inquisitive generation, thirsting after
knowledge, and therefore intolerant of obscurities formerly
unheeded. Hence it was that, early in the
eighteenth century, the powerful, but cumbrous, language,
and the long, involved sentences, so natural to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
our ancient authors, were, notwithstanding their beauty,
suddenly discarded, and were succeeded by a lighter
and simpler style, which, being more rapidly understood,
was better suited to the exigencies of the age.<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>The extension of knowledge being thus accompanied
by an increased simplicity in the manner of its communication,
naturally gave rise to a greater independence
in literary men, and a greater boldness in literary
inquiries. As long as books, either from the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
of their style, or from the general incuriosity of the
people, found but few readers, it was evident that
authors must rely upon the patronage of public bodies,
or of rich and titled individuals. And, as men are
always inclined to flatter those upon whom they are
dependent, it too often happened that even our greatest
writers prostituted their abilities by fawning upon the
prejudices of their patrons. The consequence was
that literature, so far from disturbing ancient superstitions,
and stirring up the mind to new inquiries,
frequently assumed a timid and subservient air, natural
to its subordinate position. But now all this was
changed. Those servile and shameful dedications;<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
that mean and crouching spirit; that incessant homage
to mere rank and birth; that constant confusion between
power and right; that ignorant admiration for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
everything which is old, and that still more ignorant
contempt for everything which, is new:&mdash;all these features
became gradually fainter: and authors, relying
upon the patronage of the people, began to advocate
the claims of their new allies with a boldness upon
which they could not have ventured in any previous
age.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>From all these things there resulted consequences of
vast importance. From this simplification, independence,
and diffusion<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> of knowledge, it necessarily
happened, that the issue of those great disputes to
which I have alluded became, in the eighteenth century,
more generally known than would have been possible
in any preceding century. It was now known
that theological and political questions were being constantly
agitated, in which genius and learning were on
one side, and orthodoxy and tradition on the other.
It became known that the points which were mooted
were not only as to the credibility of particular facts,
but also as to the truth of general principles, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the interests and happiness of Man were intimately concerned.
Disputes which had hitherto been confined to
a very small part of society began to spread far and
wide, and suggest doubts that served as materials for
national thought. The consequence was, that the spirit
of inquiry became every year more active, and more
general; the desire for reform constantly increased;
and if affairs had been allowed to run on in their natural
course, the eighteenth century could not have passed
away without decisive and salutary changes both in the
church and the state. But soon after the middle of
this period, there unfortunately arose a series of political
combinations which disturbed the march of events,
and eventually produced a crisis so full of danger, that,
among any other people, it would certainly have ended
either in a loss of liberty or in a dissolution of government.
This disastrous reaction, from the effects of which
England has, perhaps, barely recovered, has never been
studied with anything like the care its importance
demands; indeed, it is so little understood, that no historian
has traced the opposition between it and that
great intellectual movement of which I have just
sketched an outline. On this account, as also with the
view of giving more completeness to the present chapter,
I intend to examine its most important epochs, and
point out, so far as I am able, the way in which they
are connected with each other. According to the
scheme of this Introduction, such an inquiry must, of
course, be very cursory, as its sole object is to lay a
foundation for those general principles, without which
history is a mere assemblage of empirical observations,
unconnected, and therefore unimportant. It must likewise
be remembered, that as the circumstances about
to be considered were not social, but political, we are
the more liable to err in our conclusions respecting
them; and this partly because the materials for the
history of a people are more extensive, more indirect,
and therefore less liable to be garbled, than are those
for the history of a government; and partly because the
conduct of small bodies of men, such as ministers and
kings, is always more capricious, that is to say, less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
regulated by known laws, than is the conduct of those
large bodies collectively called society, or a nation.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>
With this precautionary remark, I will now endeavour
to trace what, in a mere political point of view, is the
reactionary and retrogressive period of English history.</p>

<p>It must be considered as a most fortunate circumstance,
that after the death of Anne,<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> the throne should
be occupied for nearly fifty years by two princes, aliens
in manners and in country, of whom one spoke our language
but indifferently, and the other knew it not at
all.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> The immediate predecessors of George III. were,
indeed, of so sluggish a disposition, and were so profoundly
ignorant of the people they undertook to
govern,<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> that, notwithstanding their arbitrary temper,
there was no danger of their organizing a party to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
extend the boundaries of the royal prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> And
as they were foreigners, they never had sufficient sympathy
with the English church to induce them to aid
the clergy in their natural desire to recover their former
power.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> Besides this, the fractious and disloyal
conduct of many of the hierarchy must have tended to
alienate the regard of the sovereign, as it had already
cost them the affection of the people.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>These circumstances, though in themselves they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
be considered trifling, were in reality of great importance,
because they secured to the nation the progress
of that spirit of inquiry, which, if there had been
a coalition between the crown and the church, it would
have been attempted to stifle. Even as it was, some
attempts were occasionally made; but they were comparatively
speaking rare, and they lacked the vigour
which they would have possessed, if there had been an
intimate alliance between the temporal and spiritual
authorities. Indeed, the state of affairs was so favourable,
that the old Tory faction, pressed by the people
and abandoned by the crown, was unable for more than
forty years to take any share in the government.<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
At the same time, considerable progress, as we shall
hereafter see, was made in legislation; and our statute-book,
during that period, contains ample evidence of
the decline of the powerful party by which England
had once been entirely ruled.</p>

<p>But by the death of George II. the political aspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
was suddenly changed, and the wishes of the sovereign
became once more antagonistic to the interests of the
people. What made this the more dangerous was, that,
to a superficial observer, the accession of George III.
was one of the most fortunate events that could have
occurred. The new king was born in England, spoke
English as his mother tongue,<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> and was said to look
upon Hanover as a foreign country, whose interests
were to be considered of subordinate importance.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> At
the same time, the last hopes of the House of Stuart
were now destroyed;<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> the Pretender himself was
languishing in Italy, where he shortly after died; and
his son, a slave to vices which seemed hereditary in that
family, was consuming his life in an unpitied and
ignominious obscurity.<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<p>And yet these circumstances, which appeared so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
favourable, did of necessity involve the most disastrous
consequences. The fear of a disputed succession being
removed, the sovereign was emboldened to a course on
which he otherwise would not have ventured.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> All
those monstrous doctrines respecting the rights of
kings, which the Revolution was supposed to have
destroyed, were suddenly revived.<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> The clergy, abandoning
the now hopeless cause of the Pretender, displayed
the same zeal for the House of Hanover which
they had formerly displayed for the House of Stuart.
The pulpits resounded with praises of the new king, of
his domestic virtues, of his piety, but above all of his
dutiful attachment to the English church. The result
was, the establishment of an alliance between the two
parties more intimate than any that had been seen in
England since the time of Charles I.<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> Under their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
auspices, the old Tory faction rapidly rallied, and were
soon able to dispossess their rivals of the management
of the government. This reactionary movement was
greatly aided by the personal character of George III.;
for he, being despotic as well as superstitious, was
equally anxious to extend the prerogative, and strengthen
the church. Every liberal sentiment, everything approaching
to reform, nay, even the mere mention of
inquiry, was an abomination in the eyes of that narrow
and ignorant prince. Without knowledge, without
taste, without even a glimpse of one of the sciences, or
a feeling for one of the fine arts, education had done
nothing to enlarge a mind which nature had more than
usually contracted.<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> Totally ignorant of the history
and resources of foreign countries, and barely knowing
their geographical position, his information was scarcely
more extensive respecting the people over whom he was
called to rule. In that immense mass of evidence now
extant, and which consists of every description of private
correspondence, records of private conversation
and of public acts, there is not to be found the slightest
proof that he knew any one of those numerous things
which the governor of a country ought to know; or,
indeed, that he was acquainted with a single duty of
his position, except that mere mechanical routine of
ordinary business, which might have been effected by
the lowest clerk in the meanest office in his kingdom.</p>

<p>The course of proceeding which such a king as this
was likely to follow could be easily foreseen. He
gathered round his throne that great party, who, clinging
to the tradition of the past, have always made it
their boast to check the progress of their age. During
the sixty years of his reign, he, with the sole exception
of Pitt, never willingly admitted to his councils a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
man of great ability;<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> not one whose name is associated
with any measure of value either in domestic or
in foreign policy. Even Pitt only maintained his position
in the state by forgetting the lessons of his illustrious
father, and abandoning those liberal principles in
which he had been educated, and with which he entered
public life. Because George III. hated the idea of
reform, Pitt not only relinquished what he had before
declared to be absolutely necessary,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> but did not hesitate
to persecute to the death the party with whom he
had once associated in order to obtain it.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> Because
George III. looked upon slavery as one of those good
old customs which the wisdom of his ancestors had
consecrated, Pitt did not dare to use his power for procuring
its abolition, but left to his successors the glory
of destroying that infamous trade, on the preservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
of which his royal master had set his heart.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> Because
George III. detested the French, of whom he knew as
much as he knew of the inhabitants of Kamtchatka or
of Tibet, Pitt, contrary to his own judgment, engaged
in a war with France by which England was seriously
imperilled, and the English people burdened with a
debt that their remotest posterity will be unable to
pay.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> But, notwithstanding all this, when Pitt, only
a few years before his death, showed a determination to
concede to the Irish some small share of their undoubted
rights, the king dismissed him from office; and the
king's friends, as they were called,<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> expressed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
indignation at the presumption of a minister who could
oppose the wishes of so benign and gracious a master.<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>
And when, unhappily for his own fame, this great man
determined to return to power, he could only recover
office by conceding that very point for which he had
relinquished it; thus setting the mischievous example
of the minister of a free country sacrificing his own
judgment to the personal prejudices of the reigning
sovereign.</p>

<p>As it was hardly possible to find other ministers, who
to equal abilities would add equal subservience, it is not
surprising that the highest offices were constantly filled
by men of notorious incapacity.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> Indeed, the king
seemed to have an instinctive antipathy to everything
great and noble. During the reign of George II. the
elder Pitt had won for himself a reputation which
covered the world, and had carried to an unprecedented
height the glories of the English name.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> He, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
as the avowed friend of popular rights, strenuously
opposed the despotic principles of the court; and for
this reason he was hated by George III. with a hatred
that seemed barely compatible with a sane mind.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>
Fox was one of the greatest statesmen of the eighteenth
century, and was better acquainted than any other with
the character and resources of those foreign nations
with which our own interests were intimately connected.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>
To this rare and important knowledge he
added a sweetness and an amenity of temper which
extorted the praises even of his political opponents.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>
But he, too, was the steady supporter of civil and
religious liberty; and he, too, was so detested by
George III., that the king, with his own hand, struck
his name out of the list of privy councillors,<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
declared that he would rather abdicate the throne than
admit him to a share in the government.<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p>While this unfavourable change was taking place in
the sovereign and ministers of the country, a change
equally unfavourable was being effected in the second
branch of the imperial legislature. Until the reign of
George III., the House of Lords was decidedly superior
to the House of Commons in the liberality and general
accomplishments of its members. It is true, that in
both houses there prevailed a spirit which must be
called narrow and superstitious, if tried by the larger
standard of the present age. But among the peers
such feelings were tempered by an education that raised
them far above those country gentlemen and ignorant
fox-hunting squires of whom the lower house was then
chiefly composed. From this superiority in their
knowledge, there naturally followed a larger and more
liberal turn of thought than was possessed by those
who were called the representatives of the people. The
result was, that the old Tory spirit, becoming gradually
weaker in the upper house, took refuge in the lower;
where, for about sixty years after the Revolution, the
high-church party and the friends of the Stuarts formed
a dangerous faction.<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> Thus, for instance, the two
men who rendered the most eminent services to the
Hanoverian dynasty, and therefore to the liberties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
England, were undoubtedly Somers and Walpole.
Both of them were remarkable for their principles of
toleration, and both of them owed their safety to the
interference of the House of Lords. Somers, early in
the eighteenth century, was protected by the peers from
the scandalous prosecution instituted against him by
the other house of parliament.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> Forty years after
this, the Commons, who wished to hunt Walpole to
the death, carried up a bill encouraging witnesses to
appear against him by remitting to them the penalties
to which they might be liable.<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> This barbarous measure
had been passed through the lower house without
the least difficulty; but in the Lords it was rejected by
a preponderance of nearly two to one.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> In the same
way the Schism Act, by which the friends of the church
subjected the dissenters to a cruel persecution,<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> was
hurried through the Commons by a large and eager
majority.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> In the Lords, however, the votes were
nearly balanced; and although the bill was passed,
amendments were added by which the violence of its
provisions was in some degree softened.<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<p>This superiority of the upper house over the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
was, on the whole, steadily maintained during the reign
of George II.;<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> the ministers not being anxious to
strengthen the high-church party in the Lords, and the
king himself so rarely suggesting fresh creations as to
cause a belief that he particularly disliked increasing
their numbers.<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p>It was reserved for George III., by an unsparing use
of his prerogative, entirely to change the character of
the upper house, and thus lay the foundation for that
disrepute into which since then the peers have been
constantly falling. The creations he made were numerous
beyond all precedent; their object evidently being
to neutralize the liberal spirit hitherto prevailing, and
thus turn the House of Lords into an engine for resisting
the popular wishes, and stopping the progress
of reform.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> How completely this plan succeeded, is
well known to the readers of our history; indeed, it
was sure to be successful, considering the character of
the men who were promoted. They consisted almost
entirely of two classes: of country gentlemen, remarkable
for nothing but their wealth, and the number
of votes their wealth enabled them to control;<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
and of mere lawyers, who had risen to judicial appointments
partly from their professional learning, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
chiefly from the zeal with which they repressed the
popular liberties, and favoured the royal prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>That this is no exaggerated description, may be ascertained
by any one who will consult the lists of the new
peers made by George III. Here and there we find an
eminent man, whose public services were so notorious
that it was impossible to avoid rewarding them;
but, putting aside those who were in a manner forced
upon the sovereign, it would be idle to deny that the
remainder, and of course the overwhelming majority,
were marked by a narrowness and illiberality of sentiment
which, more than anything else, brought the
whole order into contempt.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> No great thinkers; no
great writers; no great orators; no great statesmen;
none of the true nobility of the land,&mdash;were to be found
among the spurious nobles created by George III. Nor
were the material interests of the country better represented
in this strange composition. Among the most
important men in England, those engaged in banking
and commerce held a high place: since the end of the
seventeenth century their influence had rapidly increased;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
while their intelligence, their clear, methodical
habits, and their general knowledge of affairs, made
them every way superior to those classes from whom
the upper house was now recruited. But in the reign
of George III. claims of this sort were little heeded;
and we are assured by Burke, whose authority on such
a subject no one will dispute, that there never had been
a time in which so few persons connected with commerce
were raised to the peerage.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>It would be endless to collect all the symptoms which
mark the political degeneracy of England during this
period; a degeneracy the more striking, because it was
opposed to the spirit of the time, and because it took
place in spite of a great progress, both social and intellectual.
How that progress eventually stopped the
political reaction, and even forced it to retrace its own
steps, will appear in another part of this work; but
there is one circumstance which I cannot refrain from
noticing at some length, since it affords a most interesting
illustration of the tendency of public affairs, while at
the same time it exhibits the character of one of the
greatest men, and, Bacon alone excepted, the greatest
thinker, who has ever devoted himself to the practice of
English politics.</p>

<p>The slightest sketch of the reign of George III. would
indeed be miserably imperfect if it were to omit the
name of Edmund Burke. The studies of this extraordinary
man not only covered the whole field of political
inquiry,<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> but extended to an immense variety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
subjects, which, though apparently unconnected with
politics, do in reality bear upon them as important
adjuncts; since, to a philosophic mind, every branch of
knowledge lights up even those that seem most remote
from it. The eulogy passed upon him by one who was
no mean judge of men,<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> might be justified, and more
than justified, by passages from his works, as well as
by the opinions of the most eminent of his contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>
Thus it is, that while his insight into the
philosophy of jurisprudence has gained the applause of
lawyers,<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> his acquaintance with the whole range and
theory of the fine arts has won the admiration of artists;<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
a striking combination of two pursuits, often,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
though erroneously, held to be incompatible with each
other. At the same time, and notwithstanding the occupations
of political life, we know on good authority, that
he had paid great attention to the history and filiation
of languages;<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> a vast subject, which within the last
thirty years has become an important resource for the
study of the human mind, but the very idea of which
had, in its large sense, only begun to dawn upon a
few solitary thinkers. And, what is even more remarkable,
when Adam Smith came to London full of those
discoveries which have immortalized his name, he found
to his amazement that Burke had anticipated conclusions
the maturing of which cost Smith himself many
years of anxious and unremitting labour.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>To these great inquiries, which touch the basis of
social philosophy, Burke added a considerable acquaintance
with physical science, and even with the practice
and routine of mechanical trades. All this was so
digested and worked into his mind, that it was ready
on every occasion; not, like the knowledge of ordinary
politicians, broken and wasted in fragments, but blended
into a complete whole, fused by a genius that gave life
even to the dullest pursuits. This, indeed, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
characteristic of Burke, that in his hands nothing was
barren. Such was the strength and exuberance of his
intellect, that it bore fruit in all directions, and could
confer dignity upon the meanest subjects, by showing
their connexion with general principles and the part
they have to play in the great scheme of human affairs.</p>

<p>But what has always appeared to me still more
remarkable in the character of Burke, is the singular
sobriety with which he employed his extraordinary
acquirements. During the best part of his life, his
political principles, so far from being speculative, were
altogether practical. This is particularly striking, because
he had every temptation to adopt an opposite
course. He possessed materials for generalization far
more ample than any politician of his time, and he had
a mind eminently prone to take large views. On many
occasions, and indeed whenever an opportunity occurred,
he showed his capacity as an original and speculative
thinker. But the moment he set foot on political
ground, he changed his method. In questions connected
with the accumulation and distribution of wealth
he saw that it was possible, by proceeding from a few
simple principles, to construct a deductive science
available for the commercial and financial interests of
the country. Further than this he refused to advance,
because he knew that, with this single exception, every
department of politics was purely empirical, and was
likely long to remain so. Hence it was, that he recognized
in all its bearings that great doctrine, which even
in our own days is too often forgotten, that the aim
of the legislator should be, not truth, but expediency.
Looking at the actual state of knowledge, he was forced
to admit, that all political principles have been raised
by hasty induction from limited facts; and that, therefore,
it is the part of a wise man, when he adds to the
facts, to revise the induction, and, instead of sacrificing
practice to principles, modify the principles that he may
change the practice. Or, to put this in another way,
he lays it down that political principles are at the best
but the product of human reason; while political practice
has to do with human nature and human passions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
of which reason forms but a part;<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> and that, on this
account, the proper business of a statesman is, to contrive
the means by which certain ends may be effected, leaving
it to the general voice of the country to determine what
those ends shall be, and shaping his own conduct, not
according to his own principles, but according to the
wishes of the people for whom he legislates, and whom
he is bound to obey.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>It is these views, and the extraordinary ability with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
which they were advocated, which make the appearance
of Burke a memorable epoch in our political history.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a>
We had, no doubt, other statesmen before him, who
denied the validity of general principles in politics;
but their denial was only the happy guess of ignorance,
and they rejected theories which they had never taken
the pains to study. Burke rejected them because he
knew them. It was his rare merit that, notwithstanding
every inducement to rely upon his own generalizations,
he resisted the temptation; that, though rich in
all the varieties of political knowledge, he made his
opinions subservient to the march of events; that he
recognized as the object of government, not the preservation
of particular institutions, nor the propagation
of particular tenets, but the happiness of the people at
large; and, above all, that he insisted upon an obedience
to the popular wishes, which no statesman before him
had paid, and which too many statesmen since him
have forgotten. Our country, indeed, is still full of
those vulgar politicians, against whom Burke raised
his voice; feeble and shallow men, who, having spent
their little force in resisting the progress of reform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
find themselves at length, compelled to yield; and
then, so soon as they have exhausted the artifices of
their petty schemes, and, by their tardy and ungraceful
concessions, have sown the seed of future disaffection,
they turn upon the age by which they have been
baffled; they mourn over the degeneracy of mankind;
they lament the decay of public spirit; and they weep
for the fate of a people, who have been so regardless of
the wisdom of their ancestors, as to tamper with a
constitution already hoary with the prescription of
centuries.</p>

<p>Those who have studied the reign of George III. will
easily understand the immense advantage of having a
man like Burke to oppose these miserable delusions;
delusions which have been fatal to many countries, and
have more than once almost ruined our own.<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> They
will also understand that, in the opinion of the king,
this great statesman was, at best, but an eloquent declaimer,
to be classed in the same category with Fox
and Chatham; all three ingenious men, but unsafe,
unsteady, quite unfit for weighty concerns, and by no
means calculated for so exalted an honour as admission
into the royal councils. In point of fact, during the
thirty years Burke was engaged in public life, he
never once held an office in the cabinet;<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
only occasions on which he occupied even a subordinate
post, were in those very short intervals when the
fluctuations of politics compelled the appointment of
a liberal ministry.</p>

<p>Indeed the part taken by Burke in public affairs must
have been very galling to a king who thought everything
good that was old, and everything right that was
established.<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> For, so far was this remarkable man in
advance of his contemporaries, that there are few of
the great measures of the present generation which he
did not anticipate, and zealously defend. Not only
did he attack the absurd laws against forestalling and
regrating,<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> but, by advocating the freedom of trade,
he struck at the root of all similar prohibitions.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> He
supported those just claims of the Catholics,<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
during his lifetime, were obstinately refused; but which
were conceded, many years after his death, as the only
means of preserving the integrity of the empire. He
supported the petition of the Dissenters, that they
might be relieved from the restrictions to which, for
the benefit of the Church of England, they were subjected.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>
Into other departments of politics he carried
the same spirit. He opposed the cruel laws against
insolvents,<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> by which, in the time of George III., our
statute-book was still defaced; and he vainly attempted
to soften the penal code,<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> the increasing severity of
which was one of the worst features of that bad
reign.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> He wished to abolish the old plan of enlisting
soldiers for life;<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> a barbarous and impolitic practice,
as the English legislature began to perceive several
years later.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> He attacked the slave-trade;<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> which,
being an ancient usage, the king wished to preserve, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
part of the British constitution.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> He refuted,<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> but,
owing to the prejudices of the age, was unable to subvert,
the dangerous power exercised by the judges,
who, in criminal prosecutions for libel, confined the
jury to the mere question of publication; thus
taking the real issue into their own hands, and
making themselves the arbiters of the fate of those who
were so unfortunate as to be placed at their bar.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
And, what many will think not the least of his merits,
he was the first in that long line of financial reformers
to whom we are deeply indebted.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Notwithstanding
the difficulties thrown in his way, he carried through
Parliament a series of bills, by which several useless
places were entirely abolished, and, in the single office
of paymaster-general, a saving effected to the country
of 25,000<i>l.</i> a year.<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p>These things alone are sufficient to explain the animosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
of a prince whose boast it was, that he would
bequeath the government to his successor in the same
state as that in which he had received it. There was,
however, another circumstance by which the royal
feelings were still further wounded. The determination
of the king to oppress the Americans was so
notorious that, when the war actually broke out, it was
called the &lsquo;king's war,&rsquo; and those who opposed it were
regarded as the personal enemies of their sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>
In this, however, as in all other questions, the conduct
of Burke was governed, not by traditions and principles,
such as George III. cherished, but by large views
of general expediency. Burke, in forming his opinions
respecting this disgraceful contest, refused to be guided
by arguments respecting the right of either party.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>
He would not enter into any discussion as to whether
a mother country has the right to tax her colonies, or
whether the colonies have a right to tax themselves.
Such points he left to be mooted by those politicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
who, pretending to be guided by principles, are, in
reality, subjugated by prejudice.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> For his own part
he was content to compare the cost with the gain.
It was enough for Burke that, considering the power
of our American colonies, considering their distance
from us, and considering the probability of their being
aided by France, it was not advisable to exercise the
power; and it was, therefore, idle to talk of the right.
Hence he opposed the taxation of America, not because
it was unprecedented, but because it was inexpedient.
As a natural consequence he likewise opposed the
Boston-Port Bill, and that shameful bill, to forbid all
intercourse with America, which was not inaptly called
the starvation plan; violent measures, by which the
king hoped to curb the colonies, and break the spirit of
those noble men, whom he hated even more than he
feared.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p>It is certainly no faint characteristic of those times,
that a man like Burke, who dedicated to politics abilities
equal to far nobler things, should, during thirty years,
have received from his prince neither favour nor reward.
But George III. was a king whose delight it
was to raise the humble and exalt the meek. His reign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
indeed, was the golden age of successful mediocrity;
an age in which little men were favoured, and great
men depressed; when Addington was cherished as a
statesman, and Beattie pensioned as a philosopher; and
when, in all the walks of public life, the first conditions
of promotion were, to fawn upon ancient prejudices,
and support established abuses.</p>

<p>This neglect of the most eminent of English politicians
is highly instructive; but the circumstances which
followed, though extremely painful, have a still deeper
interest, and are well worth the attention of those
whose habits of mind lead them to study the intellectual
peculiarities of great men.</p>

<p>For, at this distance of time, when his nearest relations
are no more, it would be affectation to deny that
Burke, during the last few years of his life, fell into a
state of complete hallucination. When the French
Revolution broke out, his mind, already fainting under
the weight of incessant labour, could not support the
contemplation of an event so unprecedented, so appalling,
and threatening results of such frightful magnitude.
And, when the crimes of that great revolution,
instead of diminishing, continued to increase, then it
was that the feelings of Burke finally mastered his
reason; the balance tottered; the proportions of that
gigantic intellect were disturbed. From this moment,
his sympathy with present suffering was so intense,
that he lost all memory of the tyranny by which the
sufferings were provoked. His mind, once so steady,
so little swayed by prejudice and passion, reeled under
the pressure of events which turned the brains of thousands.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
And whoever will compare the spirit of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
latest works with the dates of their publication, will
see how this melancholy change was aggravated by
that bitter bereavement, from which he never rallied,
and which alone was sufficient to prostrate the understanding
of one in whom the severity of the reason
was so tempered, so nicely poised, by the warmth of the
affections. Never, indeed, can there be forgotten those
touching, those exquisite allusions to the death of that
only son, who was the joy of his soul, and the pride of
his heart, and to whom he fondly hoped to bequeath
the inheritance of his imperishable name. Never can
we forget that image of desolation under which the
noble old man figured his immeasurable grief &lsquo;I live
in an inverted order. They who ought to have succeeded
me, have gone before me. They who should
have been to me as posterity, are in the place of ancestors&hellip;. The storm has gone over me, and I lie
like one of those old oaks which the late hurricane has
scattered about me. I am stripped of all my honours;
I am torn up by the roots, and lie prostrate on the
earth.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>It would, perhaps, be displaying a morbid curiosity,
to attempt to raise the veil, and trace the decay of so
mighty a mind.<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> Indeed, in all such cases, most of
the evidence perishes; for those who have the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
opportunities of witnessing the infirmities of a great
man, are not those who most love to relate them. But
it is certain, that the change was first clearly seen
immediately after the breaking out of the French Revolution;
that it was aggravated by the death of his son;
and that it became progressively worse till death closed
the scene.<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> In his <i>Reflections on the French Revolution</i>;
in his <i>Remarks on the Policy of the Allies</i>: in his
<i>Letter to Elliot</i>; in his <i>Letter to a Noble Lord</i>; and in his
<i>Letters on a Regicide Peace</i>, we may note the consecutive
steps of an increasing, and at length an uncontrollable,
violence. To the single principle of hatred of the
French Revolution, he sacrificed his oldest associations
and his dearest friends. Fox, as is well known, always
looked up to Burke as to a master, from whose lips he
had gathered the lessons of political wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Burke,
on his side, fully recognized the vast abilities of his
friend, and loved him for that affectionate disposition,
and for those winning manners, which, it has often
been said, none who saw them could ever resist. But
now, without the slightest pretence of a personal
quarrel, this long intimacy<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> was rudely severed.
Because Fox would not abandon that love of popular
liberty which they had long cherished in common,
Burke, publicly, and in his place in parliament, declared
that their friendship was at an end; for that he
would never more hold communion with a man who
lent his support to the French people.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> At the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
time, and indeed the very evening on which this
occurred, Burke, who had hitherto been remarkable for
the courtesy of his manners,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> deliberately insulted
another of his friends, who was taking him home in his
carriage; and, in a state of frantic excitement, insisted
on being immediately set down, in the middle of the
night, in a pouring rain, because he could not, he said,
remain seated by &lsquo;a friend to the revolutionary doctrines
of the French.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a></p>

<p>Nor is it true, as some have supposed, that this
mania of hostility was solely directed against the
criminal part of the French people. It would be
difficult, in that or in any other age, to find two men of
more active, or indeed enthusiastic benevolence, than
Condorcet and La Fayette. Besides this, Condorcet
was one of the most profound thinkers of his time, and
will be remembered as long as genius is honoured
among us.<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> La Fayette was no doubt inferior to
Condorcet in point of ability; but he was the intimate
friend of Washington, on whose conduct he modelled
his own,<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> and by whose side he had fought for the
liberties of America: his integrity was, and still is,
unsullied: and his character had a chivalrous and noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
turn, which Burke, in his better days, would have been
the first to admire.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> Both, however, were natives of
that hated country whose liberties they vainly attempted
to achieve. On this account, Burke declared Condorcet
to be guilty of &lsquo;impious sophistry;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> to be a &lsquo;fanatic
atheist, and furious democratic republican;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> and to
be capable of &lsquo;the lowest, as well as the highest and
most determined villainies.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> As to La Fayette, when
an attempt was made to mitigate the cruel treatment he
was receiving from the Prussian government, Burke
not only opposed the motion made for that purpose in
the House of Commons, but took the opportunity of
grossly insulting the unfortunate captive, who was then
languishing in a dungeon.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> So dead had he become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
on this subject, even to the common instincts of our
nature, that, in his place in parliament, he could find no
better way of speaking of this injured and high-souled
man, than by calling him a ruffian: &lsquo;I would not,&rsquo; says
Burke,&mdash;&lsquo;I would not debase my humanity by supporting
an application in behalf of such a horrid ruffian.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>As to France itself, it is &lsquo;Cannibal Castle;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> it is

regicide pettifogger;&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> and we were taunted with
having sent a &lsquo;peer of the realm to the scum of the

Why, then, need men travel in it? Why
need our children learn its language? and why are we to
endanger the morals of our ambassadors? who can
hardly fail to return from such a land with their principles
corrupted, and with a wish to conspire against their
own country.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

<p>This is sad, indeed, from such a man as Burke once
was; but what remains, shows still more clearly how
the associations and composition of his mind had been
altered. He who, with humanity not less than with
wisdom, had strenuously laboured to prevent the
American war, devoted the last few years of his life to
kindle a new war, compared to which that with America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
was a light and trivial episode. In his calmer moments,
no one would have more willingly recognized that the
opinions prevalent in any country are the inevitable
results of the circumstances in which that country had
been placed. But now he sought to alter those opinions
by force. From the beginning of the French Revolution,
he insisted upon the right, and indeed upon the
necessity, of compelling France to change her principles;<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>
and, at a later period, he blamed the allied sovereigns
for not dictating to a great people the government
they ought to adopt.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> Such was the havoc circumstances
had made in his well-ordered intellect, that to this
one principle he sacrificed every consideration of justice,
of mercy, and of expediency. As if war, even in its mildest
form, were not sufficiently hateful, he sought to give to
it that character of a crusade<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> which increasing knowledge
had long since banished: and loudly proclaiming
that the contest was religious rather than temporal, he
revived old prejudices in order to cause fresh crimes.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
He also declared that the war should be carried on for
revenge as well as for defence, and that we must never
lay down our arms until we had utterly destroyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
men by whom the Revolution was brought about.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>
And, as if these things were not enough, he insisted
that this, the most awful of all wars, being begun, was
not to be hurried over; although it was to be carried
on for revenge as well as for religion, and the resources
of civilized men were to be quickened by the ferocious
passions of crusaders, still it was not to be soon ended;
it was to be durable; it must have permanence; it
must, says Burke, in the spirit of a burning hatred, be
protracted in a long war: &lsquo;I speak it emphatically, and
with a desire that it should be marked, in a <i>long</i> war.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>

<p>It was to be a war to force a great people to change
their government. It was to be a war carried on for the
purpose of punishment. It was also to be a religious
war. Finally, it was to be a long war. Was there ever
any other man who wished to afflict the human race with
such extensive, searching, and protracted calamities?
Such cruel, such reckless, and yet such deliberate
opinions, if they issued from a sane mind, would immortalize
even the most obscure statesman, because they
would load his name with imperishable infamy. For
where can we find, even among the most ignorant or
most sanguinary politicians, sentiments like these?
Yet they proceed from one who, a very few years
before, was the most eminent political philosopher England
has ever possessed. To us it is only given to
mourn over so noble a wreck. More than this no one
should do. We may contemplate with reverence the
mighty ruin; but the mysteries of its decay let no man
presume to invade, unless, to use the language of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
greatest of our masters, he can tell how to minister to
a diseased mind, pluck the sorrows which are rooted in
the memory, and raze out the troubles that are written
in the brain.</p>

<p>It is a relief to turn from so painful a subject, even
though we descend to the petty, huckstering politics of
the English court. And truly, the history of the treatment
experienced by the most illustrious of our politicians,
is highly characteristic of the prince under
whom he lived. While Burke was consuming his life
in great public services, labouring to reform our finances,
improve our laws, and enlighten our commercial
policy,&mdash;while he was occupied with these things, the
king regarded him with coldness and aversion.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> But
when the great statesman degenerated into an angry
brawler; when, irritated by disease, he made it the
sole aim of his declining years to kindle a deadly war
between the two first countries of Europe, and declared
that to this barbarous object he would sacrifice all
other questions of policy, however important they
might be;<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>&mdash;then it was that a perception of his vast
abilities began to dawn upon the mind of the king.
Before this, no one had been bold enough to circulate
in the palace even a whisper of his merits. Now,
however, in the successive, and eventually the rapid
decline of his powers, he had fallen almost to the level
of the royal intellect; and now he was first warmed by
the beams of the royal favour. Now he was a man
after the king's own heart.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> Less than two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
before his death, there was settled upon him, at the
express desire of George III., two considerable pensions;<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a>
and the king even wished to raise him to the
peerage, in order that the House of Lords might benefit
by the services of so great a counsellor.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p>This digression respecting the character of Burke
has been longer than I had anticipated; but it will not,
I hope, be considered unimportant; for, in addition to
the intrinsic interest of the subject, it illustrates the
feelings of George III. towards great men, and it shows
what the opinions were which in his reign it was
thought necessary to hold. In the sequel of this
work, I shall trace the effect of such opinions upon the
interests of the country, considered as a whole; but
for the object of the present Introduction, it will be
sufficient to point out the connexion in one or two more
of those prominent instances, the character of which is
too notorious to admit of discussion.</p>

<p>Of these leading and conspicuous events, the American
war was the earliest, and for several years it almost
entirely absorbed the attention of English politicians.
In the reign of George II. a proposal had been made to
increase the revenue by taxing the colonies; which, as
the Americans were totally unrepresented in parliament,
was simply a proposition to tax an entire people
without even the form of asking their consent. This
scheme of public robbery was rejected by that able and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
moderate man who was then at the head of affairs; and
the suggestion, being generally deemed impracticable,
fell to the ground, and seems, indeed, hardly to have
excited attention.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> But what was deemed by the
government of George II. to be a dangerous stretch
of arbitrary power, was eagerly welcomed by the
government of George III. For the new king, having
the most exalted notion of his own authority, and being,
from his miserable education, entirely ignorant of public
affairs, thought that to tax the Americans for the
benefit of the English, would be a masterpiece of policy.
When, therefore, the old idea was revived, it met with
his cordial acquiescence; and when the Americans
showed their intention of resisting this monstrous injustice,
he was only the more confirmed in his opinion
that it was necessary to curb their unruly will. Nor
need we be surprised at the rapidity with which such
angry feelings broke out. Indeed, looking, on the one
hand, at the despotic principles which, for the first
time since the Revolution, were now revived at the
English court; and looking, on the other hand, at the
independent spirit of the colonists,&mdash;it was impossible to
avoid a struggle between the two parties; and the only
questions were, as to what form the contest would take,
and towards which side victory was most likely to
incline.<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a></p>

<p>On the part of the English government, no time was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
lost. Five years after the accession of George III., a
bill was brought into parliament to tax the Americans;<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>
and so complete had been the change in
political affairs, that not the least difficulty was found
in passing a measure which, in the reign of George II.,
no minister had dared to propose. Formerly, such a
proposal, if made, would certainly have been rejected;
now the most powerful parties in the state were united
in its favour. The king, on every occasion, paid a
court to the clergy, to which, since the death of Anne,
they had been unaccustomed; he was, therefore, sure
of their support, and they zealously aided him in every
attempt to oppress the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> The aristocracy, a
few leading Whigs alone excepted, were on the same
side, and looked to the taxation of America as a means
of lessening their own contributions.<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> As to George
III., his feelings on the subject were notorious;<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
the more liberal party not having yet recovered from
the loss of power consequent on the death of George II.,
there was little fear of difficulties from the cabinet; it
being well known that the throne was occupied by a
prince whose first object was to keep ministers in strict
dependence on himself, and who, whenever it was
practicable, called into office such weak and flexible
men as would yield unhesitating submission to his
wishes.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<p>Everything being thus prepared, there followed those
events which were to be expected from such a combination.
Without stopping to relate details which are
known to every reader, it may be briefly mentioned
that, in this new state of things, the wise and forbearing
policy of the preceding reign was set at naught,
and the national councils guided by rash and ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
men, who soon brought the greatest disasters upon the
country, and within a few years actually dismembered
the empire. In order to enforce the monstrous claim
of taxing a whole people without their consent, there
was waged against America a war ill-conducted, unsuccessful,
and, what is far worse, accompanied by
cruelties disgraceful to a civilized nation.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> To this
may be added, that an immense trade was nearly annihilated;
every branch of commerce was thrown into
confusion;<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> we were disgraced in the eyes of Europe;<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>
we incurred an expense of 140,000,000<i>l.</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>
and we lost by far the most valuable colonies any nation
has ever possessed.</p>

<p>Such were the first fruits of the policy of George III.
But the mischief did not stop there. The opinions
which it was necessary to advocate in order to justify
this barbarous war, recoiled upon ourselves. In order
to defend the attempt to destroy the liberties of America,
principles were laid down which, if carried into effect,
would have subverted the liberties of England. Not
only in the court, but in both houses of parliament,
from the episcopal bench, and from the pulpits of the
church-party, there were promulgated doctrines of the
most dangerous kind&mdash;doctrines unsuited to a limited
monarchy, and, indeed, incompatible with it. The
extent to which this reaction proceeded is known to
very few readers, because the evidence of it is chiefly
to be found in the parliamentary debates, and in the
theological literature, particularly the sermons of that
time, none of which are now much studied. But, not
to anticipate matters belonging to another part of this
work, it is enough to say that the danger was so imminent
as to make the ablest defenders of popular liberty
believe that everything was at stake; and that if the
Americans were vanquished, the next step would be to
attack the liberties of England, and endeavour to
extend to the mother-country the same arbitrary
government which by that time would have been
established in the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p>Whether or not these fears were exaggerated, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
question of considerable difficulty; but after a careful
study of that time, and a study too from sources not
much used by historians, I feel satisfied that they who
are best acquainted with the period will be the most
willing to admit that, though the danger may have
been overrated, it was far more serious than men are
now inclined to believe. At all events, it is certain
that the general aspect of political affairs was calculated
to excite great alarm. It is certain, that during
many years, the authority of the crown continued to
increase, until it reached a height of which no example
had been seen in England for several generations. It
is certain that the Church of England exerted all
her influence in favour of those despotic principles
which the king wished to enforce. It is also certain
that, by the constant creation of new peers, all holding
the same views, the character of the House of Lords
was undergoing a slow but decisive change; and that,
whenever a favourable opportunity arose, high judicial
appointments and high ecclesiastical appointments
were conferred upon men notorious for their leaning
towards the royal prerogative. These are facts which
cannot be denied; and, putting them together, there
remains, I think, no doubt, that the American war was
a great crisis in the history of England, and that if the
colonists had been defeated, our liberties would have
been for a time in considerable jeopardy. From that
risk we were saved by the Americans, who with heroic
spirit resisted the royal armies, defeated them at every
point, and at length, separating themselves from the
mother-country, began that wonderful career, which,
in less than eighty years, has raised them to an unexampled
prosperity, and which to us ought to be
deeply interesting, as showing what may be effected
by the unaided resources of a free people.</p>

<p>Seven years after this great contest had been
brought to a successful close, and the Americans,
happily for the interests of mankind, had finally
secured their independence, another nation rose up
and turned against its rulers. The history of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
causes of the French Revolution will be found in
another part of this volume; at present we have only
to glance at the effects it produced upon the policy of
the English government. In France, as is well known,
the movement was extremely rapid; the old institutions,
which were so corrupted as to be utterly unfit
for use, were quickly destroyed; and the people,
frenzied by centuries of oppression, practised the most
revolting cruelties, saddening the hour of their triumph
by crimes that disgraced the noble cause for which
they struggled.</p>

<p>All this, frightful as it was, did nevertheless form a
part of the natural course of affairs; it was the old
story of tyranny exciting revenge, and revenge blinding
men to every consequence except the pleasure of
glutting their own passions. If, under these circumstances,
France had been left to herself, the Revolution,
like all other revolutions, would soon have subsided,
and a form of government have arisen suited to the
actual condition of things. What the form would
have been, it is impossible now to say; that, however,
was a question with which no foreign country had the
slightest concern. Whether it should be an oligarchy,
or a despotic monarchy, or a republic, it was for
France to decide; but it was evidently not the
business of any other nation to decide for her. Still
less was it likely that, on so delicate a point, France
would submit to dictation from a country which had
always been her rival, and which not unfrequently
had been her bitter and successful enemy.</p>

<p>But these considerations, obvious as they are, were
lost upon George III., and upon those classes which
were then in the ascendant. The fact that a great
people had risen against their oppressors disquieted
the consciences of men in high places. The same evil
passions, and indeed the same evil language, which a
few years before were directed against the Americans,
were now turned against the French; and it was but
too clear that the same results would follow.<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
defiance of every maxim of sound policy, the English
ambassador was recalled from France simply because
that country chose to do away with the monarchy, and
substitute a republic in its place. This was the first
decisive step towards an open rupture, and it was
taken, not because France had injured England, but
because France had changed her government.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> A
few months later, the French, copying the example of
the English in the preceding century,<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> brought their
king to a public trial, sentenced him to die, and struck
off his head in the midst of his own capital. It must
be allowed that this act was needless, that it was cruel,
and that it was grossly impolitic. But it is palpably
evident that they who consented to the execution were
responsible only to God and their country; and that
any notice of it from abroad, which bore the appearance
of a threat, would rouse the spirit of France, would
unite all parties into one, and would induce the nation
to adopt as its own a crime of which it might otherwise
have repented, but which it could not now abjure
without incurring the shame of having yielded to the
dictation of a foreign power.</p>

<p>In England, however, as soon as the fate of the
king was known, the government, without waiting for
explanation, and without asking for any guarantee as
to the future, treated the death of Louis as an offence
against itself, and imperiously ordered the French
residents to quit the country:<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> thus wantonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
originating a war which lasted twenty years, cost the
lives of millions, plunged all Europe into confusion, and,
more than any other circumstance, stopped the march
of civilization, by postponing for a whole generation
those reforms, which, late in the eighteenth century,
the progress of affairs rendered indispensable.</p>

<p>The European results of this, the most hateful, the
most unjust, and the most atrocious war, England has
ever waged against any country, will be hereafter
considered;<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> at present I confine myself to a short
summary of its leading effects on English society.</p>

<p>What distinguishes this sanguinary contest from all
preceding ones, and what gives to it its worst feature,
is, that it was eminently a war of opinions,&mdash;a war
which we carried on, not with a view to territorial
acquisitions, but with the object of repressing that
desire for reforms of every kind, which had now become
the marked characteristic of the leading countries of
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> As soon, therefore, as hostilities began the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
English government had a twofold duty to perform
it had to destroy a republic abroad, and it had to prevent
improvement at home. The first of these duties
it fulfilled by squandering the blood and the treasure
of England, till it had thrown nearly every family
into mourning, and reduced the country to the verge
of national bankruptcy. The other duty it attempted
to execute by enacting a series of laws intended to put
an end to the free discussion of political questions, and
stifle that spirit of inquiry which was every year
becoming more active. These laws were so comprehensive,
and so well calculated to effect their purpose,
that if the energy of the nation had not prevented
their being properly enforced, they would either have
destroyed every vestige of popular liberty, or else
have provoked a general rebellion. Indeed, during
several years the danger was so imminent, that, in the
opinion of some high authorities, nothing could have
averted it, but the bold spirit with which our English
juries, by their hostile verdicts, resisted the proceedings
of government, and refused to sanction laws
which the crown had proposed, and to which a timid
and servile legislature had willingly consented.<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a></p>

<p>We may form some idea of the magnitude of the
crisis by considering the steps which were actually
taken against the two most important of all our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
institutions, namely, the freedom of the public press,
and the right of assembling in meetings for the purpose
of public discussion. These are, in a political point
of view, the two most striking peculiarities which
distinguish us from every other European people. As
long as they are preserved intact, and as long as they
are fearlessly and frequently employed, there will
always be ample protection against those encroachments
on the part of government which cannot be
too jealously watched, and to which even the freest
country is liable. To this may be added, that these
institutions possess other advantages of the highest
order. By encouraging political discussion, they
increase the amount of intellect brought to bear
upon the political business of the country. They also
increase the total strength of the nation, by causing
large classes of men to exercise faculties which would
otherwise lie dormant, but which by these means are
quickened into activity, and become available for other
purposes of social interest.</p>

<p>But in the period we are now considering, it was
deemed advisable that the influence of the people
should be lessened; it was, therefore, thought improper
that they should strengthen their abilities by exercising
them. To relate the details of that bitter war,
which, late in the eighteenth century, the English
government carried on against every kind of free discussion,
would lead me far beyond the limits of this
Introduction; and I can only hastily refer to the
vindictive prosecutions, and, whenever a verdict was
obtained, the vindictive punishments, of men like
Adams, Bonney, Crossfield, Frost, Gerald, Hardy,
Holt, Hodson, Holcroft, Joyce, Kidd, Lambert,
Margarot, Martin, Muir, Palmer, Perry, Skirving,
Stannard, Thelwall, Tooke, Wakefield, Wardie,
Winterbotham: all of whom were indicted, and many
of whom were fined, imprisoned, or transported, because
they expressed their sentiments with freedom, and
because they used language such as in our time is
employed with perfect impunity, by speakers at public
meetings, and by writers in the public press.</p>

<p>As, however, juries in several cases refused to convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
men who were prosecuted for these offences, it was
determined to recur to measures still more decisive.
In 1795, a law was passed, by which it was manifestly
intended to put an end for ever to all popular discussions
either on political or religious matters. For by
it every public meeting was forbidden, unless notice of
it were inserted in a newspaper five days beforehand;<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
such notice to contain a statement of the objects of
the meeting, and of the time and place where it
was to assemble. And, to bring the whole arrangement
completely under the supervision of government,
it was ordered, that not only should the notice, thus
published, be signed by householders, but that the
original manuscript should be preserved, for the information
of the justices of the peace, who might require
a copy of it: a significant threat, which, in those days,
was easily understood.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> It was also enacted that,
even after these precautions had been taken, any single
justice might compel the meeting to disperse, if, in his
opinion, the language held by the speakers was calculated
to bring the sovereign or the government into
contempt; while, at the same time, he was authorized
to arrest those whom he considered to be the offenders.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>
The power of dissolving a public meeting, and
of seizing its leaders, was thus conferred upon a
common magistrate, and conferred too without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
slightest provision against its abuse. In other words,
the right of putting an end to all public discussions on
the most important subjects, was lodged in the hands
of a man appointed by the crown, and removable by
the crown at its own pleasure. To this it was added,
that if the meeting should consist of twelve, or upwards
of twelve persons, and should remain together for one
hour after being ordered to separate,&mdash;in such case, the
penalty of death was to be inflicted, even if only twelve
disobeyed this the arbitrary command of a single and
irresponsible magistrate.<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>In 1799, another law was passed, forbidding any
open field, or place of any kind, to be used for lecturing,
or for debating, unless a specific license for such
place had been obtained from the magistrates. It was
likewise enacted, that all circulating-libraries, and all
reading-rooms, should be subject to the same provision;

Before shops of this sort could be opened, a license
must first be obtained from two justices of the peace;

and might be revoked at any intermediate period.<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> If

<p>To modern ears it sounds somewhat strange, that
the owner of a public reading-room should not only
incur extravagant fines, but should also be punished as
the keeper of a disorderly house; and that all this
should happen to him, simply because he opened his
shop without asking permission from the local magistrates.
Strange, however, as this appears, it was, at
all events, consistent, since it formed part of a regular
plan for bringing, not only the actions of men, but
even their opinions, under the direct control of the
executive government. Thus it was that the laws, now
for the first time passed, against newspapers, were so
stringent, and the prosecution of authors so unrelenting,
that there was an evident intention to ruin every
public writer who expressed independent sentiments.<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
These measures, and others of a similar character,
which will hereafter be noticed, excited such alarm,
that, in the opinion of some of the ablest observers,
the state of public affairs was becoming desperate,
perhaps irretrievable. The extreme despondency with
which, late in the eighteenth century, the best friends
of liberty looked to the future, is very observable, and
forms a striking feature in their private correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>
And although comparatively few men venture
to express such sentiments in public, Fox, whose fearless
temper made him heedless of risk, openly stated
what would have checked the government, if anything
could have done so. For this eminent statesman,
who had been minister more than once, and was
afterwards minister again, did not hesitate to say, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
his place in parliament, in 1795, that if these, and
other shameful laws which were proposed, should be
actually passed, forcible resistance to the government
would be merely a question of prudence; and that the
people, if they felt themselves equal to the conflict,
would be justified in withstanding the arbitrary
measures by which their rulers sought to extinguish
their liberties.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p>Nothing, however, could stop the government in its
headlong career. The ministers, secure of a majority
in both houses of parliament, were able to carry their
measures in defiance of the people, who opposed them
by every mode short of actual violence.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> And as the
object of these new laws was, to check the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
inquiry, and prevent reforms, which the progress of
society rendered indispensable, there were also brought
into play other means subservient to the same end. It
is no exaggeration to say, that for some years England
was ruled by a system of absolute terror.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> The ministers
of the day, turning a struggle of party into a war
of proscription, filled the prisons with their political
opponents, and allowed them, when in confinement, to
be treated with shameful severity.<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> If a man was
known to be a reformer, he was constantly in danger
of being arrested; and if he escaped that, he was
watched at every turn, and his private letters were
opened as they passed through the post-office.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> In such
cases, no scruples were allowed. Even the confidence
of domestic life was violated. No opponent of government
was safe under his own roof, against the tales of
eavesdroppers and the gossip of servants. Discord was
introduced into the bosom of families, and schisms
caused between parents and their children.<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
only were the most strenuous attempts made to silence
the press, but the booksellers were so constantly prosecuted
that they did not dare to publish a work if
its author were obnoxious to the court.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> Indeed,
whoever opposed the government was proclaimed an
enemy to his country.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> Political associations and
public meetings were strictly forbidden. Every popular
leader was in personal danger; and every popular
assemblage was dispersed, either by threats or by military
execution. That hateful machinery, familiar to
the worst days of the seventeenth century, was put into
motion. Spies were paid; witnesses were suborned;
juries were packed.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> The coffee-houses, the inns,
and the clubs, were filled with emissaries of the government,
who reported the most hasty expressions of
common conversation.<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> If, by these means, no sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
of evidence could be collected, there was another
resource, which was unsparingly used. For, the habeas-corpus
act being constantly suspended, the crown had
the power of imprisoning without inquiry, and without
limitation, any person offensive to the ministry, but of
whose crime no proof was attempted to be brought.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>

<p>Such was the way in which, at the end of the eighteenth
century, the rulers of England, under pretence
of protecting the institutions of the country, oppressed
the people, for whose benefit alone those institutions
ought to exist. Nor was even this the whole of the
injury they actually inflicted. Their attempts to stop
the progress of opinions were intimately connected
with that monstrous system of foreign policy, by which
there has been entailed upon us a debt of unexampled
magnitude. To pay the interest of this, and to meet
the current expenses of a profuse and reckless administration,
taxes were laid upon nearly every product of
industry and of nature. In the vast majority of cases,
these taxes fell upon the great body of the people,<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>
who were thus placed in a position of singular hardship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
For the upper classes not only refused to the rest of the
nation the reforms which were urgently required, but
compelled the country to pay for the precautions which,
in consequence of the refusal, it was thought necessary
to take. Thus it was that the government diminished
the liberties of the people, and wasted the fruit of their
industry, in order to protect that very people against
opinions which the growth of their knowledge had
irresistibly forced upon them.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that, in the face of these circumstances,
some of the ablest observers should have
despaired of the liberties of England, and should have
believed that, in the course of a few years, a despotic
government would be firmly established. Even we,
who, looking at these things half a century after they
occurred, are able to take a calmer view, and who moreover
possess the advantages of a larger knowledge, and
a riper experience, must nevertheless allow that, so far
as political events were concerned, the danger was more
imminent than at any moment since the reign of
Charles I. But what was forgotten then, and what is
too often forgotten now, is, that political events form
only one of the many parts which compose the history
of a great country. In the period we have been considering,
the political movement was, no doubt, more
threatening than it had been for several generations.
On the other hand, the intellectual movement was, as
we have seen, highly favourable, and its influence
was rapidly spreading. Hence it was that, while the
government of the country tended in one direction, the
knowledge of the country tended in another; and
while political events kept us back, intellectual events
urged us forward. In this way, the despotic principles
that were enforced were, in some degree, neutralized;
and although it was impossible to prevent them from
causing great suffering, still the effect of that suffering
was to increase the determination of the people to
reform a system under which such evils could be inflicted.
For while they felt the evils, the knowledge
which they had obtained made them see the remedy.
They saw that the men who were at the head of affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
were despotic; but they saw, too, that the system must
be wrong, which could secure to such men such authority.
This confirmed their dissatisfaction, and justified
their resolution to effect some fresh arrangement, which
should allow their voices to be heard in the councils of
the state.<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> And that resolution, I need hardly add,
grew stronger and stronger, until it eventually produced
those great legislative reforms which have already
signalized the present century, have given a new tone
to the character of public men, and changed the structure
of the English parliament.</p>

<p>It is thus that, in the latter part of the eighteenth
century, the increase and diffusion of knowledge were
in England, directly antagonistic to the political events
which occurred during the same period. The extent
and the nature of that antagonism I have endeavoured
to explain, as clearly as the complexity of the subject,
and the limits of this Introduction, enable me to do.
We have seen that, looking at our country as a whole,
the obvious tendency of affairs was to abridge the
authority of the church, the nobles, and the crown, and
thus give greater play to the power of the people.
Looking, however, at the country, not as a whole, but
looking merely at its political history, we find that the
personal peculiarities of George III., and the circumstances
under which he came to the throne, enabled
him to stop the great progress, and eventually cause a
dangerous reaction. Happily for the fortunes of England,
those principles of liberty which he and his
supporters wished to destroy, had before his reign
become so powerful, and so widely diffused, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
not only resisted this political reaction, but seemed to
gain fresh strength from the contest. That the struggle
was arduous, and at one time extremely critical, it is
impossible to deny. Such, however, is the force of
liberal opinions, when they have once taken root in
the popular mind, that notwithstanding the ordeal to
which they were exposed, and notwithstanding the
punishments inflicted on their advocates, it was found
impossible to stifle them; it was found impossible
even to prevent their increase. Doctrines subversive
of every principle of freedom were personally
favoured by the sovereign, openly avowed by the
government, and zealously defended by the most
powerful classes; and laws in accordance with these
doctrines were placed on our statute-book, and enforced
in our courts. All, however, was in vain. In a few
years that generation began to pass away; a better one
succeeded in its place; and the system of tyranny fell
to the ground. And thus it is, that in all countries
which are even tolerably free, every system must fall
if it opposes the march of opinions, and gives
shelter to maxims and institutions repugnant to the
spirit of the age. In this sort of contest, the ultimate
result is never doubtful. For the vigour of an arbitrary
government depends merely on a few individuals,
who, whatever their abilities may be, are liable, after
their death, to be replaced by timid and incompetent
successors. But the vigour of public opinion is not
exposed to these casualties; it is unaffected by the laws
of mortality; it does not flourish to-day and decline
to-morrow; and so far from depending on the lives of
individual men, it is governed by large general causes,
which, from their very comprehensiveness, are in short
periods scarcely seen, but on a comparison of long
periods, are found to outweigh all other considerations,
and reduce to insignificance those little stratagems by
which princes and statesmen think to disturb the order
of events, and mould to their will the destinies of a
great and civilized people.</p>

<p>These are broad and general truths, which will
hardly be questioned by any man who, with a competent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
knowledge of history, has reflected much on the nature
and conditions of modern society. But during
the period we have been considering, they were utterly
neglected by our political rulers, who not only thought
themselves able to check the growth of opinions, but
entirely mistook the very end and object of government.
In those days, it was believed that government
is made for the minority, to whose wishes the majority
are bound humbly to submit. It was believed that the
power of making laws must always be lodged in the
hands of a few privileged classes; that the nation at
large has no concern with those laws, except to obey
them;<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> and that it is the duty of a wise government
to secure the obedience of the people by preventing
them from being enlightened by the spread of knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>
We may surely deem it a remarkable circumstance,
that these notions, and the schemes of
legislation founded upon them, should, within half a
century, have died away so completely, that they are
no longer advocated, even by men of the most ordinary
abilities. What is still more remarkable is, that this
great change should have been effected, not by any
external event, nor by a sudden insurrection of the
people, but by the unaided action of moral force,&mdash;the
silent, though overwhelming pressure of public opinion.
This has always seemed to me a decisive proof of the
natural, and, if I may so say, the healthy march of
English civilization. It is a proof of an elasticity, and
yet a sobriety of spirit, such as no other nation has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
displayed. No other nation could have escaped from
such a crisis, except by passing through a revolution,
of which the cost might well have exceeded the gain.
The truth, however, is, that in England the course of
affairs, which I have endeavoured to trace since the
sixteenth century, had diffused among the people a
knowledge of their own resources, and a skill and
independence in the use of them, imperfect, indeed,
but still far superior to that possessed by any other of
the great European countries. Besides this, other circumstances,
which will be hereafter related,<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> had, so
early as the eleventh century, begun to affect our
national character, and had assisted in imparting to it
that sturdy boldness, and, at the same time, those
habits of foresight, and of cautious reserve, to which
the English mind owes its leading peculiarities. With
us, therefore, the love of liberty has been tempered by
a spirit of prudence, which has softened its violence,
without impairing its strength. It is this which, more
than once, has taught our countrymen to bear even
considerable oppression rather than run the risk of
rising against their oppressors. It has taught them to
stay their hands; it has taught them to husband their
force until they can use it with irresistible effect. To
this great and valuable habit we owe the safety of
England late in the eighteenth century. If the people
had risen, they would have staked their all; and what
the result of that desperate game would have been, no
man can say. Happily for them, and for their posterity,
they were content to wait yet a little; they were willing
to bide their time, and watch the issue of things.
Of this noble conduct their descendants reap the reward.
After the lapse of a few years, the political crisis began
to subside, and the people re-entered on their former
rights. For although their rights had been in abeyance,
they were not destroyed, simply because the spirit still
existed by which they were originally won. Nor can
any one doubt that, if those evil days had been prolonged,
that same spirit which had animated their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
fathers in the reign of Charles I. would have again
broken forth, and society have been convulsed by a
revolution, the bare idea of which is frightful to contemplate.
In the mean time, all this was avoided; and
although popular tumults did arise in different parts of
the country, and although the measures of government
caused a disaffection of the most serious kind,<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> still
the people, taken as a whole, remained firm, and
patiently reserved their force till a better time, when,
for their benefit, a new party was organized in the state,
by whom their interests were successfully advocated
even within the walls of parliament.</p>

<p>This great and salutary reaction began early in the
present century; but the circumstances which accompanied
it are so extremely complicated, and have been
so little studied, that I cannot pretend in this Introduction
to offer even a sketch of them. It is sufficient to
say, what must be generally known, that for nearly
fifty years the movement has continued with unabated
speed. Everything which has been done, has increased
the influence of the people. Blow after blow has been
directed against those classes which were once the sole
depositaries of power. The Reform Bill, the Emancipation
of the Catholics, and the Repeal of the Corn-laws,
are admitted to be the three greatest political
achievements of the present generation. Each of these
vast measures has depressed a powerful party. The
extension of the suffrage has lessened the influence of
hereditary rank, and has broken up that great oligarchy
of landowners, by which the House of Commons had
long been ruled. The abolition of Protection has still
further enfeebled the territorial aristocracy; while
those superstitious feelings by which the ecclesiastical
order is mainly upheld, received a severe shock, first
by the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, and
afterwards by the admission of Catholics into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
legislature; steps which are with reason regarded as
supplying precedents of mischievous import for the interests
of the Established Church.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> These measures,
and others which are now obviously inevitable, have
taken, and will continue to take, power from particular
sections of society, in order to confer it upon the people
at large. Indeed, the rapid progress of democratic
opinions is a fact which no one in the present day ventures
to deny. Timid and ignorant men are alarmed at
the movement; but that there is such a movement is
notorious to all the world. No one now dares to talk
of bridling the people, or of resisting their united
wishes. The utmost that is said is, that efforts should
be made to inform them as to their real interests, and
enlighten public opinion; but every one allows that, so
soon as public opinion is formed, it can no longer be
withstood. On this point all are agreed; and this new
power, which is gradually superseding every other, is
now obeyed by those very statesmen who, had they
lived sixty years ago, would have been the first to deny
its authority, ridicule its pretensions, and, if possible,
extinguish its liberty.</p>

<p>Such is the great gap which separates the public
men of our time from those who nourished under that
bad system which George III. sought to perpetuate.
And it is evident, that this vast progress was brought
about rather by destroying the system, than by improving
the men. It is also evident, that the system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
perished because it was unsuited to the age; in other
words, because a progressive people will never tolerate
an unprogressive government. But it is a mere matter
of history, that our legislators, even to the last moment,
were so terrified by the idea of innovation, that they
refused every reform until the voice of the people rose
high enough to awe them into submission, and forced
them to grant what, without such pressure, they would
by no means have conceded.</p>

<p>These things ought to serve as a lesson to our political
rulers. They ought also to moderate the presumption
of legislators, and teach them that their best
measures are but temporary expedients, which it will
be the business of a later and riper age to efface. It
would be well if such considerations were to check the
confidence, and silence the loquacity, of those superficial
men, who, raised to temporary power, think themselves
bound to guarantee certain institutions, and
uphold certain opinions. They ought clearly to understand,
that it does not lie within their function thus to
anticipate the march of affairs, and provide for distant
contingencies. In trifling matters, indeed, this may be
done without danger; though, as the constant changes
in the laws of every country abundantly prove, it is also
done without benefit. But in reference to those large
and fundamental measures which bear upon the destiny
of a people, such anticipation is worse than useless,&mdash;it
is highly injurious. In the present state of knowledge,
politics, so far from being a science, is one of the
most backward of all the arts; and the only safe course
for the legislator is, to look upon his craft as consisting
in the adaptation of temporary contrivances to temporary
emergencies.<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> His business is to follow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
age, and not at all to attempt to lead it. He should be
satisfied with studying what is passing around him;
and should modify his schemes, not according to the
notions he has inherited from his fathers, but according
to the actual exigencies of his own time. For he may
rely upon it, that the movements of society have now
become so rapid, that the wants of one generation are
no measure of the wants of another; and that men,
urged by a sense of their own progress, are growing weary
of idle talk about the wisdom of their ancestors, and are
fast discarding those trite and sleepy maxims which
have hitherto imposed upon them, but by which they
will not consent to be much longer troubled.</p>

(<i>Campbell's Chief Justices</i>, vol. i. p. 225), I will give the words of
the two immediate successors of Elizabeth. James I. says: &lsquo;The trewth
is, according to my owne knowledge, the late queene of famous memory
never punished any Papist for religion.&rsquo; <i>Works of King James</i>, London,
1616, folio, p. 252. And Charles I. says: &lsquo;I am informed, neither Queen
Elizabeth nor my father did ever avow that any priest in their times was
executed merely for religion.&rsquo; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. ii. p. 713.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_548_548" id="Footnote_548_548"></a><a href="#FNanchor_548_548"><span class="label">[548]</span></a> This was the defence set up in 1583, in a work called <i>The
Execution of Justice in England</i>, and ascribed to Burleigh. See
<i>Hallam's Const. Hist.</i> vol. i. pp. 146, 147; and <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol.
i. pp. 189&ndash;208: &lsquo;a number of persons whom they term as martyrs,&rsquo; p. 195;
and at p. 202, the writer attacks those who have &lsquo;entitled certain that
have suffered for treason to be martyrs for religion.&rsquo; In the same way,
the opponents of Catholic Emancipation in our time, found themselves
compelled to abandon the old theological ground, and to defend the
persecution of the Catholics rather by political arguments than by
religious ones. Lord Eldon, who was by far the most influential leader
of the intolerant party, said, in a speech in the House of Lords, in
1810, that &lsquo;the enactments against the Catholics were meant to guard,
not against the abstract opinions of their religion, but against the
political dangers of a faith which acknowledged a foreign supremacy.&rsquo;

persecutions which, in the seventeenth century, the Church of England
directed against her opponents: &lsquo;This is the stale pretence of the
clergy in all countries, after they have solicited the government to
make penal laws against those they call heretics or schismaticks, and
prompted the magistrates to a vigorous execution, then they lay all the
odium on the civil power for whom they have no excuse to allege, but
that such men suffered, not for religion, but for disobedience to the
laws.&rsquo; <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. xii. p. 534. See also <i>Butler's Mem. of the

competent than laymen to regulate ecclesiastical matters, this will
practically avail them nothing: &lsquo;It were unnatural not to think the
pastors and bishops of our souls a great deal more fit than men of
secular trades and callings; howbeit, when all which the wisdom of all
sorts can do is done, for the devising of laws in the church, it is the
general consent of all that giveth them the form and vigour of laws;
without which they could be no more unto us than the counsels of
physicians to the sick.&rsquo; <i>Ecclesiastical Polity</i>, book viii. sec. vi.
vol. iii. p. 303. He adds, p. 326: &lsquo;Till it be proved that some special
law of Christ hath for ever annexed unto the clergy alone the power to
make ecclesiastical laws, we are to hold it a thing most <i>consonant with
equity and reason</i>, that no ecclesiastical laws be made in a Christian
commonwealth, without consent as well of the laity as of the clergy, but
least of all without consent of the highest power.&rsquo;</p></div>

Fathers: &lsquo;Ergo Origenes, Ambrosius, Augustinus, Chrysostomus, Gelasius,
Theodoretus erant desertores fidei catholicæ? Ergo tot veterum

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_556_556" id="Footnote_556_556"></a><a href="#FNanchor_556_556"><span class="label">[556]</span></a> This large view underlies the whole of the <i>Ecclesiastical
Polity</i>. I can only afford room for a few extracts, which will be
illustrations rather than proofs: the proof will be obvious to every
competent reader of the work itself. &lsquo;True it is, the ancienter the
better ceremonies of religion are; howbeit not absolutely true and
without exception; <i>but true only so far forth as those different ages
do agree</i> in the state of those things for which, at the first, those
rites, orders, and ceremonies were instituted.&rsquo; vol. i. p. 36. &lsquo;We count
those things perfect which want nothing requisite for the end whereto
they were instituted.&rsquo; vol. i. p. 191. &lsquo;Because when a thing doth cease
to be available unto the end which gave it being, the continuance of it
must then of necessity appear superfluous.&rsquo; And even of the laws of God,
he boldly adds: &lsquo;Notwithstanding the authority of their Maker, the
mutability of that end for which they are made doth also make them
changeable.&rsquo; vol. i. p. 236. &lsquo;And therefore laws, though both ordained of
God himself, and the end for which they were ordained continuing, may
notwithstanding cease, if by alteration of persons or times they be
found unsufficient to attain unto that end.&rsquo; vol. i. p. 238. At p. 240:
&lsquo;I therefore conclude, that neither God's being Author of laws for
government of his church, nor his committing them unto Scripture, is any
reason sufficient wherefore all churches should for ever be bound to
keep them without change.&rsquo; See, too, vol. iii. p. 169, on &lsquo;the exigence
of necessity.&rsquo; Compare pp. 182, 183, and vol. i. p. 323, vol. ii. pp.
273, 424. Not a vestige of such arguments can be found in Jewel; who, on
the contrary, says (<i>Apologia</i>, p. 114), &lsquo;Certè in religionem Dei nihil
gravius dici potest, quàm si ea accusetur novitatis. Ut enim in Deo
ipso, ita in ejus cultu nihil oportet esse novum.&rsquo;</p></div>

because he pays no respect to what we venerate, is either irrelevant, or
is a mere confusion. The fact, so far as it is true, is no reproach, but
an honour; because to reverence all persons and all things is absolutely
wrong: reverence shown to that which does not deserve it, is no virtue;
no, nor even an amiable weakness, but a plain folly and sin. But if it
be meant that he is wanting in proper reverence, not respecting what is
really to be respected, that is assuming the whole question at issue,
because what we call divine, he calls an idol; and as, supposing that we
are in the right, we are bound to fall down and worship, so, supposing
him to be in the right, he is no less bound to pull it to the ground and
destroy it.&rsquo; <i>Arnold's Lectures on Modern History</i>, pp. 210, 211.
Considering the ability of Dr. Arnold, considering his great influence,

that may not justly be accused of the brewing or broaching of some new

esteem an opinion as a diurnal, after a day or two scarce worth the

there is a perspicuous statement of the arguments now commonly received
against coercing men for their religious opinions. But the most powerful
of these arguments are based entirely upon expediency, which would have
insured their rejection in an age of strong religious convictions. Some,

are noticed in <i>Coleridge's Lit. Remains</i>, vol. i. pp. 312&ndash;315; and in
another work (<i>The Friend</i>, vol. i. p. 73), he mentions, what is the

of the great European countries, says: &lsquo;Ecclesiastical power is almost
extinct as an active element in the political or social affairs of
nations or of individuals, in the cabinet or in the family circle; and a
new element, literary power, is taking its place in the government of
the world.&rsquo; <i>Laing's Denmark</i>, 1852, p. 82. On this natural tendency in
regard to legislation, see <i>Meyer</i>, <i>Esprit des Institut. Judiciaires</i>,
vol. i. p. 267 note; and a good summary in <i>Stäudlin</i>, <i>Gesch. der
theolog. Wissenschaften</i>, vol. ii. pp. 304, 305. It is not surprising to
find that many of the clergy complain of a movement so subversive of
their own power. Compare <i>Ward's Ideal of a Christian Church</i>, pp. 40,
108&ndash;111, 388; <i>Sewell's Christian Politics</i>, pp. 276, 277, 279;
<i>Palmer's Treatise on the Church</i>, vol. ii. p. 361. It is thus that
everything is tending to confirm the remarkable prediction of Sir James
Mackintosh, that &lsquo;church-power (unless some revolution, auspicious to
priestcraft, should replunge Europe in ignorance) will certainly not
survive the nineteenth century.&rsquo; <i>Mem. of Mackintosh</i>, vol. i. p. 67.</p></div>

professors, and prebendaries, are not theologians. They are logicians,
chemists, skilled in the mathematics, historians, poor commentators upon
Greek poets.&rsquo; <i>Theodore Parker's Critical and Miscellaneous Writings</i>,
1848, p. 302. At p. 33, the same high authority says: &lsquo;But, within the
present century, what has been written in the English tongue, in any
department of theological scholarship, which is of value and makes a
mark on the age? The <i>Bridgewater Treatises</i>, and the new edition of
<i>Paley</i>,&mdash;we blush to confess it,&mdash;are the best things.&rsquo; Sir William
Hamilton (<i>Discussions on Philosophy</i>, 1852, p. 699) notices the decline
of &lsquo;British theology,&rsquo; though he appears ignorant of the cause of it.
The Rev. Mr. Ward (<i>Ideal of a Christian Church</i>, p. 405) remarks, that
&lsquo;we cannot wonder, however keenly we may mourn, at the decline and fall
of dogmatic theology.&rsquo; See also <i>Lord Jeffrey's Essays</i>, vol. iv. p.
337: &lsquo;Warburton, we think, was the last of our great divines&hellip;. The
days of the Cudworths and Barrows, the Hookers and Taylors, are long
gone by.&rsquo; Dr. Parr was the only English theologian since Warburton who
possessed sufficient learning to retrieve this position; but he always
refused to do so, being, unconsciously to himself, held back by the
spirit of his age. Thus, we find him writing to Archbishop Magee, in
1823: &lsquo;As to myself, I long ago determined not to take any active part
in polemical theology.&rsquo; <i>Parr's Works</i>, vol. vii. p. 11.</p>

<p>In the same way, since the early part of the eighteenth century, hardly
any one has carefully read the Fathers, except for mere historical and
secular purposes. The first step was taken about the middle of the
seventeenth century, when the custom of quoting them in sermons began to
be abandoned. <i>Burnet's Own Time</i>, vol. i. pp. 329, 330; <i>Orme's Life of
Owen</i>, p. 184. After this they rapidly fell into contempt; and the Rev.
Mr. Dowling (<i>Study of Ecclesiast. History</i>, p. 195) asserts, that
&lsquo;Waterland, who died in 1740, was the last of our great patristical
scholars.&rsquo; To this I may add, that nine years subsequent to the death of
Waterland, the obvious decay of professional learning struck Warburton,
afterwards Bishop of Gloucester, so much, that he wrote to Jortin,
somewhat roughly, &lsquo;anything makes a divine among our parsons.&rsquo; See his
<i>Letter</i>, written in 1749, in <i>Nichols's Illustrations of Lit. Hist.</i>
vol. ii. p. 173; and for other evidence of the neglect by the clergy of
their ancient studies, see <i>Jones's Memoirs of Horne, Bishop of
Norwich</i>, pp. 68, 184; and the complaint of Dr. Knowler, in 1766, in
<i>Nichols's Lit. Anec.</i> vol. ii. p. 130. Since then, attempts have been
made at Oxford to remedy this tendency; but such attempts, being opposed
by the general march of affairs, have been, and must be, futile. Indeed,
so manifest is the inferiority of these recent efforts, that one of the
most active cultivators in that field frankly admits, that, in point of
knowledge, his own party has effected nothing; and he even asserts, with
great bitterness, that &lsquo;it is melancholy to say it, but the chief,
perhaps the only, English writer who has any claim to be considered an
ecclesiastical historian, is the infidel Gibbon.&rsquo; <i>Newman on the

is a class of persons who will misunderstand this expression; and that
there is another class who, without misunderstanding it, will
intentionally misrepresent its meaning. Hence, it may be well to state
distinctly what I wish to convey by the word &lsquo;scepticism.&rsquo; By scepticism
I merely mean hardness of belief; so that an increased scepticism is an
increased perception of the difficulty of proving assertions; or, in
other words, it is an increased application, and an increased diffusion,
of the rules of reasoning, and of the laws of evidence. This feeling of
hesitation and of suspended judgment has, in every department of
thought, been the invariable preliminary to all the intellectual
revolutions through which the human mind has passed; and without it,
there could be no progress, no change, no civilization. In physics, it
is the necessary precursor of science; in politics, of liberty; in
theology, of toleration. These are the three leading forms of
scepticism; it is, therefore, clear, that in religion the sceptic steers
a middle course between atheism and orthodoxy, rejecting both extremes,
because he sees that both are incapable of proof.</p></div>

method of Socrates produced on a very few Greek minds, is applicable to
that state through which a great part of Europe is now passing: &lsquo;The
Socratic dialectics, clearing away from the mind its mist of fancied
knowledge, and laying bare the real ignorance, produced an immediate
effect, like the touch of the torpedo. The newly-created consciousness
of ignorance was alike unexpected, painful, and humiliating,&mdash;a season
of doubt and discomfort, yet combined with an internal working and
yearning after truth, never before experienced. Such intellectual
quickening, which could never commence until the mind had been disabused
of its original illusion of false knowledge, was considered by Socrates
not merely as the index and precursor, but as the indispensable
condition of future progress.&rsquo; <i>Grote's Hist. of Greece</i>, vol. viii. pp.
614, 615, 8vo, 1851. Compare <i>Kritik der reinen Vernunft</i>, in <i>Kant's
Werke</i>, vol. ii. pp. 572, 577. &lsquo;So ist der Skeptizismus ein
Ruheplatz für die menschliche Vernunft, da sie sich über ihre
dogmatische Wanderung besinnen und den Entwurf von der Gegend machen
kann, wo sie sich befindet, um ihren Weg fernerhin mit mehrerer
Sicherheit wählen zu können, aber nicht ein Wohnplatz zum beständigen
Aufenthalte&hellip;. So ist das skeptische Verfahren zwar an sich selbst für
die Vernunftfragen nicht befriedigend, aber doch vorübend, um ihre
Vorsichtigkeit zu erwecken und auf gründliche Mittel zu weisen, die sie
in ihren rechtmässigen Besitzen sichern können.&rsquo;</p></div>

(<i>Lectures on Modern History</i>, p. 232), &lsquo;What strikes us predominantly,
is, that what, in Elizabeth's time, was a controversy between divines,
was now a great political contest between the crown and the parliament.&rsquo;
The ordinary compilers, such as Sir A. Alison (<i>Hist. of Europe</i>, vol.
i. p. 51), and others, have entirely misrepresented this movement; an
error the more singular, because the eminently political character of
the struggle was recognized by several contemporaries. Even Cromwell,
notwithstanding the difficult game he had to play, distinctly stated, in
1655, that the origin of the war was not religious. See <i>Carlyle's
Cromwell</i>, vol. iii. p. 103; and corroborative evidence in <i>Walker's
History of Independency</i>, part i. p. 132. James I. also saw that the
Puritans were more dangerous to the state than to the church: &lsquo;do not so
far differ from us in points of religion, as in their confused form of
policy and parity; being ever discontented with the present government,
and impatient to suffer any superiority; which maketh their sects
insufferable in any well-governed commonwealth.&rsquo; <i>Speech of James I.</i>,
in <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. i. p. 982. See also the observations ascribed to
De Foe, in <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. ix. p. 572: &lsquo;The king and parliament
fell out about matters of civil right; &hellip; the first difference between
the king and the English parliament did not respect religion, but civil
property.&rsquo;</p></div>

Temple, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, observes, that the throne of Charles II. was

vol. ii. p. 344. This may be illustrated by the remarks of M. Lamartine
on the execution of Louis XVI. <i>Hist. des Girondins</i>, vol. v. pp. 86&ndash;7:
&lsquo;Sa mort, au contraire, aliénait de la cause française cette partie
immense des populations qui ne juge les événements humains que par le
c&oelig;ur. La nature humaine est pathétique; la république l'oublia, elle
donna à la royauté quelque chose du martyre, à la liberté quelque chose

républicaine, et mit du côté de la royauté la sensibilité, l'intérêt,

repelled the pretensions of &lsquo;the Assembly of Divines,&rsquo; is one of many
proofs of the determination of the predominant party not to allow
ecclesiastical encroachments. See the remarkable details in <i>Parl.
Hist.</i> vol. iii. pp. 459&ndash;463; see also p. 1305. As a natural
consequence, the Independents were the first sect which, when possessed
of power, advocated toleration. Compare <i>Orme's Life of Owen</i>, pp.
63&ndash;75, 102&ndash;111; <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. xii. p. 542; <i>Walker's Hist. of
Independency</i>, part ii. pp. 50, 157, part iii. p. 22; <i>Clarendon's Hist.
of the Rebellion</i>, pp. 610, 640. Some writers ascribe great merit to
Jeremy Taylor for his advocacy of toleration (<i>Heber's Life of Taylor</i>,
p. xxvii.; and <i>Parr's Works</i>, vol. iv. p. 417); but the truth is that
when he wrote the famous <i>Liberty of Prophesying</i>, his enemies were in
power; so that he was pleading for his own interests. When, however, the
Church of England again obtained the upper hand, Taylor withdrew the
concessions which he had made in the season of adversity. See the
indignant remarks of Coleridge (<i>Lit. Remains</i>, vol. iii. p. 250), who,
though a great admirer of Taylor, expresses himself strongly on this
dereliction: see also a recently published <i>Letter to Percy, Bishop of
Dromore</i>, in <i>Nichols's Illustrations of Lit. History</i>, vol. vii. p.

8vo, 1847, pp. 452, 458) says, what is undoubtedly true, that the
hostility of Cromwell to the church was not theological, but political.
The same remark is made by Bishop Kennet. <i>Note</i> in <i>Burton's Diary</i>,

Stuarts</i>, vol. iii. pp. 37&ndash;47. But the most distinct recognition of the
principle, is in a <i>Letter from Cromwell to Major-General Crawford</i>,
recently printed in <i>Carlyle's Cromwell</i>, vol. i. pp. 201, 202, 8vo,
1846. In it Cromwell writes, &lsquo;Sir, the state, in choosing men to serve
it, takes no notice of their opinions; if they be willing faithfully to
serve it&mdash;that satisfies.&rsquo; See additional proof in <i>Carwithen's Hist. of

who does not take this into consideration. In the present Introduction,
it is impossible to discuss so large a subject; and I must reserve it
for the future part of this work, in which the history of England will

distinction between fanaticism and superstition is clearly indicated,
but not analyzed, by Archbishop Whately, in his <i>Errors of Romanism
traced to their Origin in Human Nature</i>, p. 49. This should be compared
with <i>Hume's Philosophical Works</i>, vol. iii. pp. 81&ndash;89, Edinb. 1826, on

inconvenient; so it was repealed. See <i>Blackstone's Commentaries</i>, vol.

acquainted with Charles II., both declared that he was a deist. Compare
<i>Lingard's Hist. of Engl.</i> vol. viii. p. 127, with <i>Harris's Lives of
the Stuarts</i>, vol. v. p. 55. His subsequent conversion to Catholicism is
exactly analogous to the increased devotion of Louis XIV. during the
later years of his life. In both cases, superstition was the natural
refuge of a worn-out and discontented libertine, who had exhausted all
the resources of the lowest and most grovelling pleasures.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_593_593" id="Footnote_593_593"></a><a href="#FNanchor_593_593"><span class="label">[593]</span></a> One of the most curious instances of this may be seen in
the destruction of the old notions respecting witchcraft. This important
revolution in our opinions was effected, so far as the educated classes
are concerned, between the Restoration and the Revolution; that is to
say, in 1660, the majority of educated men still believed in witchcraft;
while in 1688, the majority disbelieved it. In 1665, the old orthodox
view was stated by Chief-Baron Hale, who, on a trial of two women for
witchcraft, said to the jury: &lsquo;That there are such creatures as witches,
I make no doubt at all; for, first, the Scriptures have affirmed so
much; secondly, the wisdom of all nations hath provided laws against
such persons, which is an argument of their confidence of such a crime.&rsquo;
<i>Campbell's Lives of the Chief Justices</i>, vol. i. pp. 565, 566. This
reasoning was irresistible, and the witches were hung; but the change in
public opinion began to affect even the judges, and after this
melancholy exhibition of the Chief-Baron, such scenes became gradually
rarer; though Lord Campbell is mistaken in supposing (p. 563) that this
was &lsquo;the last capital conviction in England for the crime of
bewitching.&rsquo; So far from this, three persons were executed at Exeter for
witchcraft in 1682. See <i>Hutchinson's Historical Essay concerning
Witchcraft</i>, 1720, pp. 56, 57. Hutchinson says: &lsquo;I suppose these are the
last three that have been hanged in England.&rsquo; If, however, one may rely
upon a statement made by Dr. Parr, two witches were hung at Northampton
in 1705; and in &lsquo;1712, five other witches suffered the same fate at the
same place.&rsquo; <i>Parr's Works</i>, vol. iv. p. 182, 8vo, 1828. This is the
more shameful, because, as I shall hereafter prove, from the literature
of that time, a disbelief in the existence of witches had become almost
universal among educated men; though the old superstition was still
defended on the judgment-seat and in the pulpit. As to the opinions of
the clergy, compare <i>Cudworth's Intellect. Syst.</i> vol. iii. pp. 345,
348; <i>Vernon Correspond.</i> vol. ii. pp. 302, 303; <i>Burt's Letters from
the North of Scotland</i>, vol. i. pp. 220, 221; <i>Wesley's Journals</i>, pp.
602, 713. Wesley, who had more influence than all the bishops put
together, says: &lsquo;It is true, likewise, that the English in general, and,
indeed, most of the men of learning in Europe, have given up all
accounts of witches and apparitions as mere old wives' fables. I am
sorry for it&hellip;. The giving up witchcraft is, in effect, giving up the
Bible&hellip;. But I cannot give up, to all the Deists in Great Britain, the
existence of witchcraft, till I give up the credit of all history,
sacred and profane.&rsquo;</p>

<p>However, all was in vain. Every year diminished the old belief; and in
1736, a generation before Wesley had recorded these opinions, the laws
against witchcraft were repealed, and another vestige of superstition
effaced from the English statute-book. See <i>Barrington on the Statutes</i>,
p. 407; <i>Note</i> in <i>Burton's Diary</i>, vol. i. p. 26; <i>Harris's Life of
Hardwicke</i>, vol. i. p. 307.</p>

in his works, that it is difficult to choose among innumerable passages
which might be quoted. I will select one which strikes me as well
expressed, and is certainly very characteristic. In his <i>Free Inquiry
into the vulgarly received Notion of Nature</i>, he says (<i>Boyle's Works</i>,
vol. iv. p. 359), &lsquo;For I am wont to judge of opinions as of coins: I
consider much less, in any one that I am to receive, whose inscription
it bears, than what metal it is made of. It is indifferent enough to me
whether it was stamped many years or ages since, or came but yesterday
from the mint.&rsquo; In other places he speaks of the &lsquo;schoolmen&rsquo; and

were then becoming scarce, and that there was an intention of reprinting
the whole of them. In regard to the <i>Sceptical Chemist</i>, it was so

was to be bought for four shillings, &lsquo;pour quatre chelins.&rsquo; <i>Voyages de

says, &lsquo;The charter of the Royal Society states, that it was established
for the improvement of <i>natural</i> science. This epithet <i>natural</i> was
originally intended to imply a meaning, of which very few persons, I
believe, are aware. At the period of the establishment of the society,
the arts of witchcraft and divination were very extensively encouraged;
and the word <i>natural</i> was therefore introduced in contradistinction to
<i>supernatural</i>.&rsquo; The charters granted by Charles II. are printed in
<i>Weld's History of the Royal Society</i>, vol. ii. pp. 481&ndash;521. Evelyn
(<i>Diary,</i> 13 <i>Aug.</i> 1662, vol. ii. p. 195) mentions, that the object of
the Royal Society was &lsquo;natural knowledge.&rsquo; See also <i>Aubrey's Letters
and Lives</i>, vol. ii. p. 358; <i>Pulteney's Hist. of Botany</i>, vol. ii. pp.
97, 98; and on the distinction thus established in the popular mind

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_620_620" id="Footnote_620_620"></a><a href="#FNanchor_620_620"><span class="label">[620]</span></a> The speculative view of this tendency has been recently
illustrated in the most comprehensive manner by M. Auguste Comte, in his
<i>Philosophie Positive</i>; and his conclusions in regard to the earliest
stage of the human mind are confirmed by everything we know of barbarous
nations; and they are also confirmed, as he has decisively proved, by
the history of physical science. In addition to the facts he has
adduced, I may mention, that the history of geology supplies evidence
analogous to that which he has collected from other departments.</p>

<p>A popular notion of the working of this belief in supernatural causation
may be seen in a circumstance related by Combe. He says, that in the
middle of the eighteenth century the country west of Edinburgh was so
unhealthy, &lsquo;that every spring the farmers and their servants were seized
with fever and ague.&rsquo; As long as the cause of this was unknown, &lsquo;these
visitations were believed to be sent by Providence;&rsquo; but after a time
the land was drained, the ague disappeared, and the inhabitants
perceived that what they had believed to be supernatural was perfectly
natural, and that the cause was the state of the land, not the
intervention of the Deity. <i>Combe's Constitution of Man</i>, Edinb. 1847,
p. 156.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_621_621" id="Footnote_621_621"></a><a href="#FNanchor_621_621"><span class="label">[621]</span></a> I say apparent mystery, because it does not at all lessen
the real mystery. But this does not affect the accuracy of my remark,
inasmuch as the people at large never enter into such subtleties as the
difference between Law and Cause; a difference, indeed, which is so
neglected, that it is often lost sight of even in scientific books. All
that the people know is, that events which they once believed to be
directly controlled by the Deity, and modified by Him, are not only
foretold by the human mind, but are altered by human interference. The
attempts which Paley and others have made to solve this mystery by
rising from the laws to the cause, are evidently futile, because to the
eye of reason the solution is as incomprehensible as the problem; and
the arguments of the natural theologians, in so far as they are
arguments, must depend on reason. As Mr. Newman truly says, &lsquo;A God
uncaused and existing from eternity, is to the full as incomprehensible
as a world uncaused and existing from eternity. We must not reject the
latter theory as incomprehensible; for so is every other possible
theory.&rsquo; <i>Newman's Natural History of the Soul</i>, 1849, p. 36. The truth
of this conclusion is unintentionally confirmed by the defence of the
old method, which is set up by Dr. Whewell in his <i>Bridgewater
Treatise</i>, pp. 262&ndash;5; because the remarks made by that able writer refer
to men who, from their vast powers, were most likely to rise to that
transcendental view of religion which is slowly but steadily gaining
ground among us. Kant, probably the deepest thinker of the eighteenth
century, clearly saw that no arguments drawn from the external world
could prove the existence of a First Cause. See, among other passages,
two particularly remarkable in <i>Kritik der reinen Vernunft</i>, <i>Kant's
Werke</i>, vol. ii. pp. 478, 481, on &lsquo;der physikotheologische Beweis.&rsquo;</p></div>

meteorology, and thus prevented us from accurately predicting the
weather, compare <i>Forbes on Meteorology</i>, in <i>Second Report of British
Association</i>, pp. 249&ndash;251; <i>Cuvier</i>, <i>Progrès des Sciences</i>, vol. i. pp.
69, 248; <i>Kaemtz's Meteorology</i>, pp. 2&ndash;4; <i>Prout's Bridgewater
Treatise</i>, pp. 290&ndash;295; <i>Somerville's Physical Geog.</i> vol. ii. pp. 18,
19. But all the best authorities are agreed that this ignorance cannot
last long; and that the constant advance which we are now making in
physical science will eventually enable us to explain even these
phenomena. Thus, for instance, Sir John Leslie says, &lsquo;It cannot be
disputed, however, that all the changes which happen in the mass of our
atmosphere, involved, capricious, and irregular as they may appear, are
yet the necessary results of principles as fixed, and perhaps as simple,
as those which direct the revolutions of the solar system. Could we
unravel the intricate maze, we might trace the action of each distinct
cause, and hence deduce the ultimate effects arising from their combined
operation. With the possession of such data, we might safely predict the
state of the weather at any future period, as we now calculate an
eclipse of the sun or moon, or foretell a conjunction of the planets.&rsquo;
<i>Leslie's Natural Philosophy</i>, p. 405: see also p. 185, and the remarks
of Mr. Snow Harris (<i>Brit. Assoc. for 1844</i>, p. 241), and of Mr.
Hamilton (<i>Journal of Geog. Soc.</i> vol. xix. p. xci.) Thus, too, Dr.
Whewell (<i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>, p. 3) says, that &lsquo;the changes of winds
and skies are produced by causes, of whose rules &ldquo;no philosophical mind&rdquo;
will doubt the fixity.&rsquo;</p></div>

clearly marked, that many nations have a separate god for the weather,
to whom they say their prayers. In countries where men stop short of
this, they ascribe the changes to witchcraft, or to some other

<p>Coming to a state of society nearer our own, we find that in the ninth
century it was taken for granted in Christian countries that wind and
hail were the work of wizards (<i>Neander's Hist. of the Church</i>, vol. vi.
pp. 118, 139); that similar views passed on to the sixteenth century,
and were sanctioned by Luther (<i>Maury</i>, <i>Légendes
Pieuses</i>, pp. 18, 19); and finally, that when Swinburne was in Spain,
only eighty years ago, he found the clergy on the point of putting an
end to the opera, because they &lsquo;attributed the want of rain to the
influence of that ungodly entertainment.&rsquo; <i>Swinburne's Travels through

physical experiments were so fashionable. This is merely worth observing
as a symptom of the age, since Charles II. and the nobles were not
likely to add, and did not add, anything to our knowledge; and their
patronage of science, such as it was, degraded it rather than advanced
it. Still, the prevalence of the taste is curious; and in addition to
the picture drawn by Mr. Macaulay (<i>Hist. of England</i>, 1st edit. vol. i.

467) whispers a horrible suspicion, which I cannot believe to be true,
even of Charles II., and which Harris, who has collected some evidence
of his astounding profligacy, does not mention, though he quotes one of
the passages in Burnet. <i>Harris's Lives of the Stuarts</i>, vol. v. pp.

people of England.&rsquo; <i>Lives of the Norths</i>, vol. ii. p. 82. These are the
sort of men by whom great nations are governed. A passage in <i>Life of
James, by Himself</i>, edit. Clarke, vol. ii. p. 621, confirms the

great Revolution, which swept away the traditions and the language of

slender ability, and not at all aware of the real nature of a change, of
which the obvious and immediately practical results formed the smallest
part. The true point of view is, that it was a formal recognition by the
legislature that the Middle Ages were extinct, and that it was necessary
to inaugurate a more modern and innovating policy. Hereafter I shall

1667, the king, even at the council-board, expressed himself against the
bishops, and said, that the clergy &lsquo;thought of nothing but to get good
benefices, and to keep a good table.&rsquo; See also, on his dislike to the
bishops, vol. ii. p. 22; and <i>Pepys' Diary</i>, vol. iv. p. 2. In another
place, vol. iv. p. 42, Pepys writes: &lsquo;And I believe the hierarchy will in
a little time be shaken, whether they will or no; the king being
offended with them, and set upon it, as I hear.&rsquo; Evelyn, in a
conversation with Pepys, noticed with regret such conduct of Charles,
&lsquo;that a bishop shall never be seen about him, as the king of France hath
always.&rsquo; <i>Pepys</i>, vol. iii. p. 201. Evelyn, in his benevolent way,
ascribes this to &lsquo;the negligence of the clergy;&rsquo; but history teaches us
that the clergy have never neglected kings, except when the king has
first neglected them. Sir John Reresby gives a curious account of a
conversation Charles II. held with him respecting &lsquo;mitred heads,&rsquo; in
which the feeling of the king is very apparent. <i>Reresby's Travels and

which the clergy fell in the reign of Charles II. is perfectly accurate;
and from evidence which I have collected, I know that this very able
writer, of whose immense research few people are competent judges, has
rather understated the case than overstated it. On several subjects I
should venture to differ from Mr. Macaulay; but I cannot refrain from
expressing my admiration of his unwearied diligence, of the consummate
skill with which he has arranged his materials, and of the noble love of
liberty which animates his entire work. These are qualities which will
long survive the aspersions of his puny detractors,&mdash;men who, in point

from which it appears that this movement began about 1681. The clergy,
as a body, are naturally favourable to this doctrine; and the following
passage, published only twelve years ago, will give the reader an idea
of the views that some of them entertain. The Rev. Mr. Sewell
(<i>Christian Politics</i>, Lond. 1844, p. 157) says, that the reigning
prince is &lsquo;a being armed with supreme physical power by the hand and
permission of Providence; as such, the lord of our property, the master
of our lives, the fountain of honour, the dispenser of law, before whom
each subject must surrender his will and conform his actions&hellip;. Who,
when he errs, errs as a man, and not as a king, and is responsible, not
to man, but to God.&rsquo; And at p. 111, the same writer informs us that the
church, &lsquo;with one uniform, unhesitating voice, has proclaimed the duty
of &ldquo;passive obedience.&rdquo;&rsquo; See also on this slavish tenet, as upheld by
the church, <i>Wordsworth's Ecclesiast. Biog.</i> vol. iv. p. 668; <i>Life of
Ken, by a Layman</i>, vol. ii. p. 523; <i>Lathbury's Hist. of Convocation</i>,

ground that they thought it illegal to publish a declaration of this
kind. But such a defence is incompatible with their doctrine of passive
obedience; and besides this, it was contradicted by precedents and
decisions of their own. Jeremy Taylor, in his <i>Ductor Dubitantium</i>,
their great work of authority, asserts that &lsquo;the unlawful proclamations
and edicts of a true prince may be published by the clergy in their
several charges.&rsquo; <i>Heber's Life of Taylor</i>, p. cclxxxvi. Heber adds: &lsquo;I
wish I had not found this in Taylor; and I thank Heaven that the
principle was not adopted by the English clergy in 1687.&rsquo; But why was it
not adopted in 1687? Simply because in 1687 the king attacked the
monopoly enjoyed by the clergy; and therefore the clergy forgot their
principle, that they might smite their enemy. And what makes the motives
of this change still more palpable is, that as late as 1681, the
Archbishop of Canterbury caused the clergy to read a Declaration issued
by Charles II.; and that in a revised copy of the Liturgy he had also
added to the rubric to the same effect. See <i>Neal's Hist. of the
Puritans</i>, vol. v. p. 56. Compare <i>Calamy's Own Life</i>, vol. i. pp. 199,

this remarkable rise of the monied classes early in the eighteenth
century; but he merely observes, that the consequence was to strengthen
the Whig party. Though this is undoubtedly true, the ultimate results,
as I shall hereafter point out, were far more important than any
political or even economical consequences. It was not till 1694 that the
Bank of England was established; and this great institution at first met
with the warmest opposition from the admirers of old times, who thought
it must be useless because their ancestors did without it. See the
curious details in <i>Sinclair's Hist. of the Revenue</i>, vol. iii. pp. 6&ndash;9;

sovereign instructed in the art of overcoming the ignorant impatience of
taxation which is the invariable characteristic of free communities; and
thus gave it a government capable of turning to the best account the
activity and energy of its inhabitants, at the same time that it had the

clergy were inflicting on the church, by their conduct after the arrival
of William, is in <i>Evelyn's Diary</i>, vol. iii. p. 273,&mdash;a curious
passage, gently hinting at the &lsquo;wonder of many,&rsquo; at the behaviour of
&lsquo;the Archbishop of Canterbury, and some of the rest.&rsquo; With Evelyn, who
loved the church, this was an unpleasant subject; but others were less
scrupulous; and in parliament, in particular, men did not refrain from
expressing what must have been the sentiments of every impartial
observer. In the celebrated debate, in January 1688&ndash;9, when the throne
was declared vacant, Pollexfen said: &lsquo;Some of the clergy are for one
thing, some for another; I think they scarce know what they would have.&rsquo;
<i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. v. p. 55. In February, Maynard, one of the most
influential members, indignantly said: &lsquo;I think the clergy are out of
their wits; and I believe, if the clergy should have their wills, few or
none of us should be here again.&rsquo; <i>Ibid.</i> vol. v. p. 129. The clergy
were themselves bitterly sensible of the general hostility; and one of
them writes, in 1694: &lsquo;The people of England, who were so excessively
enamoured of us when the bishops were in the tower, that they hardly
forbore to worship us, are now, I wish I could say but cool and very
indifferent towards us.&rsquo; <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. ix. p. 525. The growing
indignation against the clergy, caused by their obvious desire to
sacrifice the country to the interests of the church, is strikingly
displayed in a letter from Sir Roland Gwyne, written in 1710, and
printed in <i>Macpherson's Orig. Papers</i>, vol. ii. p. 207.</p></div>

struggle between ecclesiastical interests and secular interests; and
this was seen as early as 1689, when, as we learn from Burnet, who was
much more a politician than a priest, &lsquo;the church was as the word given
out by the Jacobite party, under which they might more safely shelter
themselves,&rsquo; <i>Own Time</i>, vol. iv. p. 57. See also, on this
identification of the Jacobites with the church, <i>Birch's Life of
Tillotson</i>, p. 222; and the argument of Dodwell, pp. 246, 247, in 1691.
Dodwell justly observed, that the successors of the deprived bishops
were schismatical, in a spiritual point of view; and that, &lsquo;if they
should pretend to lay authority as sufficient, they would overthrow the
being of a church as a society.&rsquo; The bishops appointed by William were
evidently intruders, according to church principles; and as their
intrusion could only be justified according to lay principles, it
followed that the success of the intrusion was the triumph of lay
principles over church ones. Hence it is, that the fundamental idea of
the rebellion of 1688, is the elevation of the state above the church;
just as the fundamental idea of the rebellion of 1642, is the elevation
of the commons above the crown.</p></div>

328&ndash;330, vol. ii. pp. 338, 357, 358) gives an interesting account of
these feuds within the church, consequent upon the revolution. Indeed,
their bitterness was such, that it was necessary to coin names for the
two parties; and, between 1700 and 1702, we, for the first time, hear
the expressions, high-church and low-church. See <i>Burnet's Own Time</i>,
vol. iv. p. 447, vol. v. p. 70. Compare <i>Wilson's Life of De Foe</i>, vol.
ii. p. 26; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. vi. pp. 162, 498. On the difference
between them, as it was understood in the reign of Anne, see <i>Somers
Tracts</i>, vol. xii. p. 532, and <i>Macpherson's Orig. Papers</i>, vol. ii. p.
166. On the dawning schism in the church, see the speech of Sir T.
Littleton, in 1690, <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. v. p. 593. Hence many complained
that they could not tell which was the real church. See curious evidence
of this perplexity in <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. ix. pp. 477&ndash;481.</p></div>

1691 (<i>Life of Ken, by a Layman</i>, vol. ii. p. 599): &lsquo;If the deprived
bishop be the only lawful bishop, then the people and clergy of his
diocese are bound to own him, and no other; then all the bishops who own
the authority of a new archbishop, and live in communion with him, are
schismatics; and the clergy who live in communion with schismatical
bishops are schismatics themselves; and the whole Church of England now
established by law is schismatical.&rsquo;</p></div>

their position: &lsquo;You are now driven to this dilemma,&mdash;swear, or swear
not; if you swear, you kill the soul; and if you swear not, you kill the
body, in the loss of your bread.&rsquo; <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. xiii. p. 686.
The result of the dilemma was what might have been expected; and a
high-church writer, in the reign of William III., boasts (<i>Somers
Tracts</i>, vol. x. p. 344) that the oaths taken by the clergy were no
protection to the government: &lsquo;not that the government receives any
security from oaths.&rsquo; Whiston, too, says in his <i>Memoirs</i>, p. 30: &lsquo;Yet
do I too well remember that the far greatest part of those of the
university and clergy that then took the oaths to the government, seemed
to me to take them with a doubtful conscience, if not against its
dictates.&rsquo; This was in 1693; and, in 1710, we find: &rsquo;There are now
circumstances to make us believe that the Jacobite clergy have the like
instructions to take any oaths, to get possession of a pulpit for the
service of the cause, to bellow out the hereditary right, the pretended
title of the Pretender.&rsquo; <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. xii. p. 641. A knowledge
of this fact, or, at all events, a belief of it, was soon diffused; and,
eight years later, the celebrated Lord. Cowper, then lord chancellor,
said, in the House of Lords, &lsquo;that his majesty had also the best part of
the landed, and all the trading interest; <i>that as to the clergy, he
would say nothing&mdash;but that it was notorious that the majority of the
populace had been poisoned, and that the poison was not yet quite
expelled</i>.&rsquo; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. vii. p. 541; also given, but not quite

confuse scepticism with atheism; though the two things are not only
different, but incompatible. In regard to the quibble respecting <i>de

see note 38 in this chapter. In 1685, a complaint was made that secular

See <i>England's Wants</i>, sec. lvi. in <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. ix. p. 231,
where the writer mournfully states, that in his time &lsquo;physic and law,
professions ever acknowledged in all nations to be inferior to divinity,
are generally embraced by gentlemen, and sometimes by persons nobly
descended, and <i>preferred much above the divine's profession</i>.&rsquo; This
preference was, of course, most displayed by young men of intellect; and
a large amount of energy being thus drawn off from the church, gave rise
to that decay of spirit and of general power which has been already
noticed; and which is also indicated by Coleridge, in his remarks on the
&lsquo;apologising theology&rsquo; which succeeded the Revolution. <i>Coleridge's Lit.

that the Wesleyans have reached that point in which &lsquo;order takes the

Methodism in the middle of the eighteenth century (<i>Walpole's Letters</i>,
vol. ii. pp. 266, 272); and Lord Carlisle, in 1775, told the House of
Lords (<i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. xviii. p. 634) &lsquo;that Methodism was daily
gaining ground, particularly in the manufacturing towns;&rsquo; while, to come
down still later, it appears from a letter by the Duke of Wellington to
Lord Eldon(<i>Twiss's Life of Eldon</i>, vol. ii. p. 35) that about 1808 it
was making proselytes in the army.</p>

<p>These statements, though accurate, are somewhat vague; but we have other
and more precise evidence respecting the rapid growth of religious
dissent. According to a paper found in one of the chests of William
III., and printed by Dalrymple (<i>Memoirs</i>, vol. ii. part ii., appendix
to chapter i. p. 40), the proportion in England of conformists to
non-conformists was as 22<sup>4</sup>/<sub>5</sub> to 1. Eighty-four years after the death
of William, the dissenters, instead of comprising only a twenty-third,
were estimated at &lsquo;a fourth part of the whole community.&rsquo; Letter from
Watson to the Duke of Rutland, written in 1786, in <i>Life of Watson,
Bishop of Llandaff</i>, vol. i. p. 246. Since then, the movement has been
uninterrupted; and the returns recently published by government disclose
the startling fact, that on Sunday, 31st March 1851, the members of the
Church of England who attended morning service only exceeded by one-half
the Independents, Baptists, and Methodists who attended at their own
places of worship. See the Census Table, in <i>Journal of Statist. Soc.</i>
vol. xviii. p. 151. If this rate of decline continues, it will be
impossible for the Church of England to survive another century the
attacks of her enemies.</p></div>

clergy, many of whom were magistrates, shows what would have taken place
if such violence had not been discouraged by the government. See
<i>Southey's Life of Wesley</i>, vol. i. pp. 395&ndash;406. Wesley has himself
given many details, which Southey did not think proper to relate, of the
calumnies and insults to which he and his followers were subjected by
the clergy. See <i>Wesley's Journals</i>, pp. 114, 145, 178, 181, 198, 235,
256, 275, 375, 562, 619, 637, 646. Compare <i>Watson's Observations on
Southey's Wesley</i>, pp. 173, 174; and for other evidence of the
treatment of those who differed from the church, see <i>Correspondence and
Diary of Doddridge</i>, vol. ii. p. 17, vol. iii. pp. 108, 131, 132, 144,
145, 156. Grosley, who visited England in 1765, says of Whitefield, &lsquo;The
ministers of the established religion did their utmost to baffle the new
preacher; they preached against him, representing him to the people as a
fanatic, a visionary, &amp;c. &amp;c.; in fine, they opposed him with so much
success, that they caused him to be pelted with stones in every place
where he opened his mouth to the public.&rsquo; <i>Grosley's Tour to London</i>,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_748_748" id="Footnote_748_748"></a><a href="#FNanchor_748_748"><span class="label">[748]</span></a> That Wesleyanism encouraged dissent by imparting to it an
orderly character, which in some degree approximated to
church-discipline, is judiciously observed in <i>Bogue and Bennett's
History of the Dissenters</i>, vol. iii. pp. 165, 166. But these writers
deal rather too harshly with Wesley; though there is no doubt that he
was a very ambitious man, and over-fond of power. At an early period of
his career he began to aim at objects higher than those attempted by the
Puritans, whose efforts, particularly in the sixteenth century, he
looked at somewhat contemptuously. Thus, for instance, in 1747, only
eight years after he had revolted against the church, he expresses in
his Journal his wonder &lsquo;at the weakness of those holy confessors&rsquo; (the
Elizabethan Puritans), &lsquo;many of whom spent so much of their time and
strength in disputing about surplice and hoods, or kneeling at the
Lord's Supper!&rsquo; <i>Journals</i>, p. 249, March 13th, 1747. Such warfare as
this would have ill satisfied the soaring mind of Wesley; and from the
spirit which pervades his voluminous Journals, as well as from the
careful and far-seeing provisions which he made for managing his sect,
it is evident that this great schismatic had larger views than any of
his predecessors, and that he wished to organize a system capable of
rivalling the established church.</p></div>

entirely secular plan according to which both investigated ethics; in
other respects, there is great difference between their conclusions; but
if the anti-theological method is admitted to be sound, it is certain
that the treatment of the subject by Hume is more consequential from the
premisses, than is that by his predecessor. It is this which makes Hume
a continuator of Cumberland; though with the advantage, not only of
coming half a century after him, but of possessing a more comprehensive
mind. The ethical speculations of Hume are in the third book of his
<i>Treatise of Human Nature</i> (<i>Hume's Philosophical Works</i>, Edin. 1826,

exhibited during the last thirty years of the eighteenth century.
Previously, the geologists had, for the most part, allied themselves
with the theologians; but the increasing boldness of public opinion now
enabled them to institute independent investigations, without regard to
doctrines hitherto received. In this point of view, much was effected by
the researches of Hutton, whose work, says Sir Charles Lyell, contains
the first attempt &lsquo;to explain the former changes of the earth's crust by
reference exclusively to natural agents.&rsquo; <i>Lyell's Principles of
Geology</i>, p. 50. To establish this method was, of course, to dissolve
the alliance with the theologians; but an earlier symptom of the change
was seen in 1773, that is, fifteen years before Hutton wrote: see a
letter in <i>Watson's Life of Himself</i>, vol. i. p. 402, where it is stated
that the &lsquo;freethinkers&rsquo; attacked the &lsquo;Mosaic account of the world's
age, especially since the publication of Mr. Brydone's <i>Travels Through
Sicily and Malta</i>.&rsquo; According to Lowndes (<i>Bibliographer's Manual</i>, vol.
i. p. 279), Brydone's book was published in 1773; and in 1784 Sir
William Jones notices the tendency of these inquiries: see his
<i>Discourse on the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India</i>, in which he
observes (<i>Works</i>, vol. i. p. 233) with regret, that he lived in &lsquo;an age
when some intelligent and virtuous persons are inclined to doubt the
authenticity of the accounts delivered by Moses concerning the primitive
world.&rsquo; Since then, the progress of geology has been so rapid, that the
historical value of the writings of Moses is abandoned by all
enlightened men, even among the clergy themselves. I need only refer to
what has been said by two of the most eminent of that profession, Dr.
Arnold and Mr. Baden Powell. See the observations of Arnold in <i>Newman's
Phases of Faith</i>, p. 111 (compare pp. 122, 123); and the still more
decisive remarks in <i>Powell's Sermons on Christianity without Judaism</i>,

Raikes, in 1781; but, though he appears to have been the first to

Lit. Anec.</i> vol. i. p. 289.) How this state of things was remedied, is a
most important inquiry for the historian; but in this note I can only
give a few illustrations of the condition of different districts. The
first printing-office in Rochester was established by Fisher, who died
in 1786 (<i>Nichols's Lit. Anec.</i> vol. iii. p. 675); the first in Whitby,
was in 1770 (<i>Illustrations</i>, vol. iii. p. 787); and Richard Greene, who
died in 1793, &lsquo;was the first who brought a printing-press to Lichfield&rsquo;
(<i>Ibid.</i> vol. vi. p. 320). In the reign of Anne, there was not a single
bookseller in Birmingham (<i>Southey's Commonplace Book</i>, 1st series,
1849, p. 568); but, in 1749, we find a printer established there
(<i>Hull's Letters</i>, Lond. 1778, vol. i. p. 92); and, in 1774, there was a
printer even in Falkirk (<i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. xvii. p. 1099). In other
parts the movement was slower; and we are told that, about 1780, &lsquo;there
was scarcely a bookseller in Cornwall.&rsquo; <i>Life of Samuel Drew, by his
Son</i>, 1834, pp. 40, 41.</p></div>

themselves up to popularizing physical truths. At the beginning of the
reign of George I. Desaguliers was &lsquo;the first who read lectures in
London on experimental philosophy.&rsquo; <i>Southey's Commonplace Book</i>, 3d

and, on his elementary works, compare <i>Nichols's Lit. Anec.</i> vol. vi. p.

scientific works in numbers; a plan so well suited to that inquisitive
age, that, if we believe Horace Walpole, he &lsquo;earned fifteen guineas a
week.&rsquo; <i>Letter to Henry Zouch</i>, January 3rd, 1761, in <i>Walpole's

<p>In the latter half of the eighteenth century, the demand for books on
the natural sciences rapidly increased (see, among many other instances
which might be quoted, a note in <i>Pulteney's Hist. of Botany</i>, vol. ii.
p. 180); and, early in the reign of George III., Priestley began to
write popularly on physical subjects. (<i>Memoirs of Priestley</i>, vol. i.
pp. 288, 289.) Goldsmith did something in the same direction (<i>Prior's
Life of Goldsmith</i>, vol. i. pp. 414, 469, vol. ii. p. 198); and Pennant,
whose earliest work appeared in 1766, was &lsquo;the first who treated the
natural history of Britain in a popular and interesting style.&rsquo;
<i>Swainson on the Study of Natural History</i>, p. 50. In the reign of
George II., publishers began to encourage elementary works on chemistry.

were unknown before the accession of George II.; but, about the middle
of his reign, they began to increase. Compare <i>Wright's England under

daily paper appeared in the reign of Anne. Compare <i>Simmonds's Essay on
Newspapers</i>, in <i>Journal of Statist. Society</i>, vol. iv. p. 113, with
<i>Hunt's Hist. of Newspapers</i>, vol. i. pp. 167, 175, vol. ii. p. 90; and
<i>Nichols's Lit. Anec.</i> vol. iv. p. 80. In 1710, they, instead of merely
communicating news, as heretofore, began to take part in &lsquo;the discussion
of political topics&rsquo; (<i>Hallam's Const. Hist.</i> vol. ii. p. 443); and, as
this change had been preceded a very few years by the introduction of
cheap political pamphlets (see a curious passage in <i>Wilson's Life of De
Foe</i>, vol. ii. p. 29), it became evident that a great movement was at
hand in regard to the diffusion of such inquiries. Within twenty years
after the death of Anne, the revolution was completed; and the press,
for the first time in the history of the world, was made an exponent of
public opinion. The earliest notice of this new power which I have met
in parliament, is in a speech delivered by Danvers, in
1738; which is worth quoting, both because it marks an epoch, and
because it is characteristic of that troublesome class to which the man
belonged. &lsquo;But I believe,&rsquo; says this distinguished legislator,&mdash;&lsquo;but I
believe the people of Great Britain are governed by a power that never
was heard of, as a supreme authority, in any age or country before. This
power, sir, does not consist in the absolute will of the prince, in the
direction of parliament, in the strength of an army, in the influence of
the clergy, neither, sir, is it a petticoat government: but, sir, it is
the government of the press. The stuff which our weekly newspapers are
filled with, is received with greater reverence than acts of parliament;
and the sentiments of one of these scribblers have more weight with the
multitude than the opinion of the best politician in the kingdom.&rsquo;

1772; when, as Lord Campbell says, &lsquo;the right of publishing
parliamentary debates was substantially established.&rsquo; <i>Campbell's
Chancellors</i>, vol. v. p. 511, vol. vi. p. 90. For further information

<p>George III., always consistent and always wrong, strenuously opposed
this extension of the popular rights. In 1771, he wrote to Lord North:
&lsquo;It is highly necessary that this strange and lawless method of
publishing debates in the papers should be put a stop to. But is not the
House of Lords the best court to bring such miscreants before; as it can
fine, as well as imprison, and has broader shoulders to support the
odium of so salutary a measure?&rsquo; <i>App. to Mahon</i>, vol. v. p. xlviii.;
and <i>note</i> in <i>Walpole's George III.</i> vol. iv. p. 280, where the words,
&lsquo;in the papers,&rsquo; are omitted; but I copy the letter, as printed by Lord
Mahon. In other respects, both versions are the same; so that we now
know the idea George III. had of what constituted a miscreant.</p></div>

language before the early part of the eighteenth century. See <i>Hare's
Guesses at Truth</i>, 2nd series, 1848, p. 262. A similar change, though at
a later period, took place in France. See the observations on the word
&lsquo;individualisme,&rsquo; in <i>Tocqueville</i>, <i>Démocratie en Amérique</i>, vol. iv.

those who professed to be such) seem to have agreed in this,&mdash;that the
mass of the people were to acquiesce in the decision of their superiors,
and neither should, nor could, exercise their own minds on the
question.&rsquo; This is well put, and quite true; and should be compared with
the complaint in <i>Wakefield's Life of Himself</i>, vol. ii. p. 21;
<i>Nichols's Lit. Anec. of the Eighteenth Century</i>, vol. viii. p. 144; and

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_779_779" id="Footnote_779_779"></a><a href="#FNanchor_779_779"><span class="label">[779]</span></a> Coleridge (<i>Lit. Remains</i>, vol. i. pp. 230 seq.) has made
some interesting remarks on the vicissitudes of English style; and he
justly observes, p. 238, that, &lsquo;after the Revolution, the spirit of the
nation became much more commercial than it had been before; a learned
body, or clerisy, as such, gradually disappeared; and literature in
general began to be addressed to the common, miscellaneous public.&rsquo; He
goes on to lament this change; though, in that, I disagree with him. See
also <i>The Friend</i>, vol. i. p. 19, where he contrasts the modern style
with &lsquo;the stately march and difficult evolutions&rsquo; of the great writers
of the seventeenth century. Compare, on this alteration, the preface to
Nader Shah, in <i>Works of Sir W. Jones</i>, vol. v. p. 544. See also, in
<i>Harford's Life of Burgess</i>, pp. 40, 41, a curious letter from Monboddo,
the last of our really great pedants, mourning over this characteristic
of modern composition. He terms it contemptuously a &lsquo;short cut of a
style;&rsquo; and wishes to return to &lsquo;the true ancient taste,&rsquo; with plenty of
&lsquo;parentheses!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The truth is, that this movement was merely part of that tendency to
approximate the different classes of society which was first clearly
seen in the eighteenth century, and which influenced not only the style
of author, but also their social habits. Hume observes that, in the
&lsquo;last age,&rsquo; learned men had separated themselves too much from the
world; but that, in his time, they were becoming more &lsquo;conversible.&rsquo;
<i>Essay V.</i>, in <i>Hume's Philosophical Works</i>, vol. iv. pp. 539, 540. That
&lsquo;philosophers&rsquo; were growing men of the world, is also noticed in a
curious passage in <i>Alciphron</i>, dial. i., in <i>Berkeley's Works</i>, vol. i.
p. 312; and, respecting the general social amalgamation, see a letter to
the Countess of Bute, in 1753, in <i>Works of Lady Mary Montagu</i>, edit.
1803, vol. iv. pp. 194, 195. As to the influence of Addison, who led the
way in establishing the easy, and therefore democratic, style, and who,
more than any single writer, made literature popular, compare <i>Aikin's
Life of Addison</i>, vol. ii. p. 65, with <i>Turner's Hist. of England</i>, vol.
ii. p. 7. Subsequently a reaction was attempted by Johnson, Gibbon, and
Parr; but this, being contrary to the spirit of the age, was
short-lived.</p></div>

indeed, rewarded far more than it was worth. During the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and early part of the eighteenth century, a sum of money
was invariably presented to the author in return for his dedication. Of
course, the grosser the flattery, the larger the sum. On the relation
thus established between authors and men of rank, and on the eagerness
with which even eminent writers looked to their patrons for gratuities,
varying from 40<i>s.</i> to 100<i>l.</i>, see <i>Drake's Shakespeare and his Times</i>,
1817, 4to. vol. ii. p. 225; <i>Monk's Life of Bentley</i>, vol. i. pp. 194,

709; <i>Harris's Life of Hardwicke</i>, vol. iii. p. 35; <i>Bunbury's Life of
Hanmer</i>, p. 81. Compare a note in <i>Burton's Diary</i>, vol. iii. p. 52; and
as to the importance of fixing on a proper person to whom to dedicate,
see <i>Ellis's Letters Lit. Men</i>, pp. 231&ndash;234; and the matter-of-fact
remark in <i>Bishop Newton's Life</i>, p. 14; also, <i>Hughes's Letters</i>, edit.
1773, vol. iii. p. xxxi. appendix.</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century was the turning-point of this
deplorable condition; and Watson, for instance, in 1769, laid it down as
a rule, &lsquo;never to dedicate to those from whom I expected favours.&rsquo;
<i>Watson's Life of Himself</i>, vol. i. p. 54. So, too, Warburton, in 1758,
boasts that his dedication was not, as usual, &lsquo;occupied by trifles or
falsehoods.&rsquo; See his letter, in <i>Chatham Correspond.</i> vol. i. p. 315.
Nearly at the same period, the same change was effected in France, where
D'Alembert set the example of ridiculing the old custom. See <i>Brougham's
Men of Letters</i>, vol. ii. pp. 439, 440; <i>Correspond. de Madame

of George II., the custom of authors relying upon the patronage of
individuals was beginning to die away, and the plan of publishing by
subscription had become general. See the interesting details in <i>Le
Blanc</i>, <i>Lettres d'un Français</i>, vol. i. pp. 305&ndash;308; and for the former
state of things, see vol. ii. pp. 148&ndash;153. Burke, who came to London in
1750, observes, with surprise, that &lsquo;writers of the first talents are
left to the capricious patronage of the public. Notwithstanding
discouragement, literature is cultivated to a high degree.&rsquo; <i>Prior's
Life of Burke</i>, p. 21. This increasing independence also appears from
the fact that, in 1762, we find the first instance of a popular writer
attacking public men by name; authors having previously confined
themselves &lsquo;to the initials only of the great men whom they assailed.&rsquo;
<i>Mahon's Hist. of England</i>, vol. v. p. 19. The feud between literature

pronunciation of English; but George I. was not even able to pronounce
it badly, and could only converse with his minister, Sir Robert Walpole,
in Latin. The French court saw this state of things with great pleasure;
and in December 1714, Madame de Maintenon wrote to the Princess des
Ursins (<i>Lettres inédites de Maintenon</i>, vol. iii. p. 157): &lsquo;On dit que

II. by the recent publication of <i>Lord Hervey's Memoirs</i>; a curious
work, which fully confirms what we know from other sources respecting
the king's ignorance of English politics. Indeed, that prince cared for
nothing but soldiers and women; and his highest ambition was to combine
the reputation of a great general with that of a successful libertine.
Besides the testimony of Lord Hervey, it is certain, from other
authorities, that George II. was despised as well as disliked, and was
spoken of contemptuously by observers of his character, and even by his
own ministers. See the <i>Marchmont Papers</i>, vol. i. pp. 29, 181, 187.</p>

<p>In reference to the decline of the royal authority, it is important to

in <i>Somers Tracts</i>, vol. xiii. p. 534, contrasting the affection Anne

bore against the government of the two first Georges was openly
displayed, and was so pertinaceous as to form a leading fact in the
history of England. In 1722, Bishop Atterbury was arrested, because he
was known to be engaged in a treasonable conspiracy with the Pretender.
As soon as he was seized, the church offered up prayers for him. &lsquo;Under
the pretence,&rsquo; says Lord Mahon,&mdash;&lsquo;under the pretence of his being
afflicted with the gout, he was publicly prayed for in most of the
churches of London and Westminster.&rsquo; <i>Mahon's Hist. of England</i>, vol.
ii. p. 38. See also <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. vii. p. 988, and vol. viii. p.
347.</p>

<p>At Oxford, where the clergy have long been in the ascendant, they made
such efforts to instill their principles as to call down the indignation
of the elder Pitt, who, in a speech in Parliament in 1754, denounced
that university, which he said had for many years &lsquo;been raising a
succession of treason&mdash;there never was such a seminary!'&rsquo;<i>Walpole's Mem.
of George II.</i> vol. i. p. 413. Compare the <i>Bedford Correspondence</i>,
vol. i. pp. 594, 595, with <i>Harris's Life of Hardwicke</i>, vol. ii. p.
383; and on the temper of the clergy generally after the death of Anne,

pp. 188, 189; <i>Monk's Life of Bentley</i>, vol. i. pp. 370, 426.</p>

<p>The immediate consequence of this was very remarkable. For the
government and the dissenters, being both opposed by the church,
naturally combined together: the dissenters using all their influence
against the Pretender, and the government protecting them against
ecclesiastical prosecutions. See evidence of this in <i>Doddridge's
Correspond. and Diary</i>, vol. i. p. 30, vol. ii. p. 321, vol. iii. pp.

known that the king, in his first speech, boasted of being a Briton; but
what is, perhaps, less generally known is, that the honour was on the
side of the country: &lsquo;What a lustre,&rsquo; said the House of Lords in their

it was observed, says Horace Walpole, that &lsquo;the Earl of Litchfield, Sir
Walter Bagot, and the principal Jacobites went to court.&rsquo; <i>Walpole's
Mem. of George III.</i> vol. i. p. 14. Only three years earlier the
Jacobites had been active; and in 1757, Rigby writes to the Duke of
Bedford: &lsquo;Fox's election at Windsor is very doubtful. There is a

that it was &lsquo;essentially necessary.&rsquo; See his speech, in <i>Parl. Hist.</i>

parliamentary reform,&rsquo; vol. xxiv. p. 349; see also pp. 998, 999. Compare
<i>Disney's Life of Jebb</i>, p. 209. Nor is it true, as some have said, that
he afterwards abandoned the cause of reform because the times were
unfavourable to it. On the contrary, he, in a speech delivered in 1800,
said (<i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. xxxv. p. 47): &lsquo;Upon this subject, sir, I think
it right to state the inmost thoughts of my mind; I think it right to
declare my most decided opinion, that, <i>even if the times were proper
for experiments, any, even the slightest, change in such a constitution
must be considered as an evil</i>.&rsquo; It is remarkable that, even as early as
1783, Paley appears to have suspected the sincerity of Pitt's
professions in favour of reform. See <i>Meadley's Memoirs of Paley</i>, p.
121.</p></div>

that in 1770 &lsquo;he issued an instruction under his own hand commanding the
governor (of Virginia), upon pain of the highest displeasure, to assent
to no law by which the importation of slaves should be in any respect
prohibited or obstructed.&rsquo; <i>Bancroft's American Revolution</i>, vol. iii.
p. 456: so that, as Mr. Bancroft indignantly observes, p. 469, while the
courts of law had decided &lsquo;that as soon as any slave set his foot on
English ground he becomes free, the king of England stood in the path of
humanity, and made himself the pillar of the colonial slave-trade.&rsquo; The
shuffling conduct of Pitt in this matter makes it hard for any honest
man to forgive him. Compare <i>Brougham's Statesmen</i>, vol. ii. pp. 14,

was restrained by a desire of not wholly breaking with the court. Other
men, who were more independent in their position, and cared nothing for
the chance of future office, expressed themselves in terms such as had
never before been heard within the walls of Parliament. Rolle, for
instance, declared that &lsquo;there had been persons created peers during the
present minister's power, who were not fit to be his grooms.&rsquo; <i>Parl.

than Thurlow. In 1790, Fox stated in the House of Commons, &lsquo;that if he
were to put all the political information which he had learnt from
books, all which he had gained from science, and all which any knowledge
of the world and its affairs had taught him, into one scale, and the

the greatest part.&rsquo; <i>Observations on a late State of the Nation</i>, in
<i>Burke's Works</i>, vol. i. p. 113. Hence the distinction he had constantly
in view between the generalizations of philosophy, which ought to be
impregnable, and those of politics, which must be fluctuating; and hence
in his noble work, <i>Thoughts on the Cause of the present Discontents</i>,
he says (vol. i. p. 136), &lsquo;No lines can be laid down for civil or
political wisdom. They are a matter incapable of exact definition.&rsquo; See
also p. 151, on which he grounds his defence of the spirit of party; it
being evident that if truth were the prime object of the political art,
the idea of party, as such, would be indefensible. Compare with this the
difference between &lsquo;la vérité en soi&rsquo; and &lsquo;la vérité sociale,&rsquo; as
expounded by M. Rey in his <i>Science Sociale</i>, vol. ii. p. 322, Paris,

people are the masters. They have only to express their wants at large
and in gross. We are the expert artists; we are the skilful workmen, to
shape their desires into perfect form, and to fit the utensil to the
use. They are the sufferers, they tell the symptoms of the complaint;
but we know the exact seat of the disease, and how to apply the remedy
according to the rules of art. How shocking would it be to see us
pervert our skill into a sinister and servile dexterity, for the purpose
of evading our duty, and <i>defrauding our employers, who are our natural
lords</i>, of the object of their just expectations!&rsquo; <i>Burke's Works</i>, vol.
i. p. 254. In 1777, in his <i>Letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol</i> (<i>Works</i>,
vol. i. p. 216), &lsquo;In effect, to follow, not to force, the public
inclination; to give a direction, a form, a technical dress, and a
specific sanction, to the general sense of the community,&mdash;is the true
end of legislature.&rsquo; In his <i>Letter on the Duration of Parliament</i> (vol.
ii. p. 430), &lsquo;It would be dreadful, indeed, if there was any power in
the nation capable of resisting its unanimous desire, or even the desire
of any very great and decided majority of the people. The people may be
deceived in their choice of an object. <i>But I can scarcely conceive any
choice they can make to be so very mischievous, as the existence of any
human force capable of resisting it.</i>&rsquo; So, too, he says (vol. i. pp.
125, 214), that when government and the people differ, government is
generally in the wrong: compare pp. 217, 218, 276, vol. ii. p. 440. And
to give only one more instance, but a very decisive one, he, in 1772,
when speaking on a Bill respecting the Importation and Exportation of
Corn, said, &lsquo;On this occasion I give way to the present Bill, not
because I approve of the measure in itself, but because I think it
prudent to yield to the spirit of the times. <i>The people will have it
so; and it is not for their representatives to say nay.</i> I cannot,
however, help entering my protest against the general principles of
policy on which it is supported, because I think them extremely
dangerous.&rsquo; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. xvii. p. 480.</p></div>

that, because a country has long flourished under some particular
custom, therefore the custom must be good. See an admirable instance of
this in his speech on the power of the attorney-general to file
informations <i>ex officio</i>; where he likens such reasoners to the father
of Scriblerus, who &lsquo;venerated the rust and canker which exalted a brazen
pot-lid into the shield of a hero.&rsquo; He adds: &lsquo;But, sir, we are told that
the time during which this power existed, is the time during which
monarchy most flourished: and what, then, can no two things subsist
together but as cause and effect? May not a man have enjoyed better
health during the time that he walked with an oaken stick, than
afterwards, when he changed it for a cane, without supposing, like the
Druids, that there are occult virtues in oak, and that the stick and the
health were cause and effect?&rsquo; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. xvi. pp. 1190, 1191.</p></div>

sleep, but it keeps you from being burnt in your bed. The hue and cry

calls Burke &lsquo;one of the first and ablest financial reformers in
parliament,&rsquo; p. 104. The truth, however, is, that he was not only one of
the first, but the first. He was the first man who laid before
parliament a general and systematic scheme for diminishing the expenses
of government; and his preliminary speech on that occasion is one of the
finest of all his compositions.</p></div>

Americans, was so natural to such a mind as his, that one can hardly
blame his constant exhibition of it during the time that the struggle
was actually impending. But what is truly disgraceful is, that, after
the war was over, he displayed this rancour on an occasion when, of all
others, he was bound to suppress it. In 1786, Jefferson and Adams were
in England officially, and, as a matter of courtesy to the king, made
their appearance at court. So regardless, however, was George III. of
the common decencies of his station, that he treated these eminent men
with marked incivility, although they were then paying their respects to
him in his own palace. See <i>Tucker's Life of Jefferson</i>, vol. i. p. 220;

be admitted; but we are not bound to believe the assertion of Horace
Walpole, who says (<i>Mem. of George II.</i> vol. i. p. 397) that in 1754 he
predicted the American rebellion. Walpole, though a keen observer of the
surface of society, was not the man to take a view of this kind; unless,
as is hardly probable, he heard an opinion to that effect expressed by
his father. Sir Robert Walpole may have said something respecting the
increasing love of liberty in the colonies; but it was impossible for
him to foresee how that love would be fostered by the arbitrary
proceedings of the government of George III.</p></div>

the bitterness of the clergy against the Americans. Even in 1777, Burke
wrote to Fox: &lsquo;The Tories do universally think their power and
consequence involved in the success of this American business. The
clergy are astonishingly warm in it; and what the Tories are when
embodied and united with their natural head, the crown, and animated by
their clergy, no man knows better than yourself.&rsquo; <i>Burke's Works</i>, vol.

the land tax, at the expense of America.&rsquo; <i>Bancroft's Hist. of the
American Revolution</i>, vol. ii. p. 414. The merchants, on the other hand,
were opposed to these violent proceedings. See, on this contrast between
the landed and commercial interests, a letter from Lord Shelburne, in
1774, and another from Lord Camden, in 1775, in <i>Chatham Correspond.</i>

that the king himself suggested the taxation of America, to which
Grenville at first objected. Compare <i>Wraxall's Mem. of his own Time</i>,
vol. ii. pp. 111, 112, with <i>Nicholl's Recollections</i>, vol. i. pp. 205,
386. This may have been merely a rumour; but it is quite consistent with
everything we know of the character of George III., and there can, at
all events, be no doubt as to his feelings respecting the general
question. It is certain that he over-persuaded Lord North to engage in
the contest with America, and induced that minister to go to war, and to
continue it even after success had become hopeless. See <i>Bancroft's
American Revolution</i>, vol. iii. pp. 307, 308; <i>Russell's Mem. of Fox</i>,
vol. i. pp. 247, 254; and the <i>Bedford Correspond.</i> vol. iii. p. li. See
also, in regard to the repeal of the Stamp Act, the <i>Grenville Papers</i>,
vol. iii. p. 373; a curious passage, with which Lord Mahon, the last
edition of whose history was published in the same year (1853), appears
to have been unacquainted. <i>Mahon's Hist. of England</i>, vol. v. p. 139.
In America the sentiments of the king were well known. In 1775,
Jefferson writes from Philadelphia: &lsquo;We are told, and everything proves
it true, that he is the bitterest enemy we have.&rsquo; <i>Jefferson's
Correspond.</i> vol. i. p. 153. And in 1782 Franklin writes to Livingston,
&lsquo;The king hates us most cordially.&rsquo; <i>Life of Franklin</i>, vol. ii. p.

required ministers to be, not the public servants of the state, but the
private domestics of the sovereign.&rsquo; <i>Albemarle's Mem. of Rockingham</i>,
vol. i. p. 248. Compare <i>Bancroft's American Revolution</i>, vol. ii. p.
109. In the same way, Burke, in 1767, writes: &lsquo;His majesty never was in
better spirits. He has got a ministry weak and dependent; and, what is
better, willing to continue so.&rsquo; <i>Burke's Correspond.</i> vol. i. p. 133.
Ten years later, Lord Chatham openly taunted the king with this
disgraceful peculiarity: &lsquo;Thus to pliable men, not capable men, was the
government of this once glorious empire intrusted.&rsquo; <i>Chatham's Speech in
1777</i>, in <i>Adolphus</i>, vol. ii. pp. 499, 500.</p></div>

colonies by military force, &lsquo;that the establishment of such a power in
America will utterly ruin our finances (though its certain effect), is
the smallest part of our concern. It will become an apt, powerful, and

that Chauvelin was actually ordered to leave England, and that this was
in consequence of &lsquo;the British ministers having received information of
the execution of the king of France.&rsquo; Compare <i>Belsham</i>, vol. viii. p.

from Pitt on account of the war, and moved an amendment on the subject

i. pp. 281&ndash;4. Mr. Hunt says, p. 284: &lsquo;In addition to all these laws,
directed solely towards the press, other statutes were made to bear upon
it, for the purpose of repressing the free expression of popular
opinion.&rsquo; In 1793, Dr. Currie writes: &lsquo;The prosecutions that are
commenced by government all over England against printers, publishers,
&amp;c. would astonish you; and most of these are for offences committed
many months ago. The printer of the <i>Manchester Herald</i> has had seven
different indictments preferred against him for paragraphs in his paper;
and six <i>different</i> indictments for selling or disposing of six
different copies of Paine,&mdash;all previous to the <i>trial</i> of Paine. The
man was opulent, supposed worth 20,000<i>l.</i>; but these different actions
will ruin him, as they were intended to do.&rsquo; <i>Currie's Life</i>, vol. i.
pp. 185, 186. See also a letter from Roscoe to Lord Lansdowne, in <i>Life
of Roscoe</i>, vol. i. p. 124; and <i>Mem. of Holcroft</i>, vol. ii. pp. 151,
152: &lsquo;Printers and booksellers all over the kingdom were hunted out for
prosecution.&rsquo; See further, <i>Life of Cartwright</i>, vol. i. pp. 199, 200;

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_932_932" id="Footnote_932_932"></a><a href="#FNanchor_932_932"><span class="label">[932]</span></a> In 1793, Dr. Currie, after mentioning the attempts made
by government to destroy the liberty of the press, adds: &lsquo;For my part, I
foresee troubles, and conceive the nation was never in such a dangerous
crisis.&rsquo; <i>Currie's Mem.</i> vol. i. p. 186. In 1795, Fox writes (<i>Russell's
Mem. of Fox</i>, vol. iii. pp. 124, 125): &lsquo;There appears to me to be no
choice at present, but between an absolute surrender of the liberties of
the people and a vigorous exertion, attended, I admit, with considerable
hazard, at a time like the present. My view of things is, I own, very
gloomy; and I am convinced that, in a very few years, this government
will become completely absolute, or that confusion will arise of a
nature almost as much to be deprecated as despotism itself.&rsquo; In the same
year, Dr. Raine writes (<i>Parr's Works</i>, vol. vii. p. 533): &lsquo;The
mischievous conduct of men in power has long made this country an uneasy
dwelling for the moderate and peaceful man; their present proceedings
render our situation alarming, and our prospects dreadful.&rsquo; See also p.
530. In 1796, the Bishop of Llandaff writes (<i>Life of Watson</i>, vol. ii.
pp. 36, 37): &lsquo;The malady which attacks the constitution (influence of
the crown) is without remedy; violent applications might be used; their
success would be doubtful, and I, for one, never wish to see them
tried.&rsquo; Compare vol. i. p. 222. And, in 1799, Priestley dreaded a
revolution; but, at the same time, thought there was &lsquo;no longer any hope
of a peaceable and gradual reform.&rsquo; <i>Mem. of Priestley</i>, vol. i. pp.
198, 199.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_933_933" id="Footnote_933_933"></a><a href="#FNanchor_933_933"><span class="label">[933]</span></a> In this memorable declaration, Fox said, that &lsquo;he had a
right to hope and expect that these bills, which positively repealed the
Bill of Rights, and cut up the whole of the constitution by the roots,
by changing our limited monarchy into an absolute despotism, would not
be enacted by parliament against the declared sense of a great majority
of the people. If, however, ministers were determined, by means of the
corrupt influence they possessed in the two houses of parliament, to
pass the bills in direct opposition to the declared sense of a great
majority of the nation, and they should be put in force with all their
rigorous provisions, if his opinion were asked by the people as to their
obedience, he should tell them, that it was no longer a question of
moral obligation and duty, but of prudence. It would, indeed, be a case
of extremity alone which could justify resistance; and the only question
would be, whether that resistance was prudent.&rsquo; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol.
xxxii. p. 383. On this, Windham remarked, and Fox did not deny, that
&lsquo;the meaning obviously was, that the right hon. gentleman would advise
the people, whenever they were strong enough, to resist the execution of
the law;&rsquo; and to this both Sheridan and Grey immediately assented, pp.
385&ndash;387.</p></div>

man, so firm and decided a plurality of adversaries to the ministerial
measures, as on this occasion (<i>i.e.</i> in 1795): the interest of the
public seemed so deeply at stake, that individuals, not only of the
decent, but of the most vulgar professions, gave up a considerable
portion of their time and occupations in attending the numerous meetings
that were called in every part of the kingdom, to the professed intent
of counteracting this attempt of the ministry.&rsquo; <i>Note in Parl. History</i>,
vol. xxxii. p. 381. It was at this period that Fox made the declaration
which I have quoted in the previous note.</p></div>

statement (<i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol. xxx. p. 21), that what government had done
was, &lsquo;to erect every man, not merely into an inquisitor, but into a
judge, a spy, an informer,&mdash;to set father against father, brother
against brother; and in this way you expect to maintain the tranquillity
of the country.&rsquo; See also vol. xxx. p. 1529; and a remarkable passage,
in <i>Coleridge's Biog. Lit.</i> (vol. i. p. 192), on the extent of &lsquo;secret

See <i>Stephens's Mem. of Tooke</i>, vol. ii. pp. 345&ndash;348. In 1798, Fox wrote
to Cartwright (<i>Life of Cartwright</i>, vol. i. p. 248): &lsquo;The decision
against Wakefield's publisher appears to me decisive against the liberty
of the press; and, indeed, after it, one can hardly conceive how any
prudent tradesman can venture to publish anything that can, in any way,
be disagreeable to the ministers.&rsquo;</p></div>

suspension bill: &lsquo;Every man who talked freely, every man who detested,
as he did from his heart, this war, might be, and would be, in the hands
and at the mercy of ministers. Living under such a government, and being
subject to insurrection, comparing the two evils, he confessed, he
thought the evil they were pretending to remedy, was less than the one
they were going to inflict by the remedy itself.&rsquo; <i>Parl. Hist.</i> vol.
xxxi. p. 509. In 1800, Lord Holland stated, in the House of Lords, that,
of &lsquo;the seven years of the war, the habeas-corpus act had been suspended
five; and, of the multitudes who had been imprisoned in virtue of that
suspension, few had been brought to trial, and only one convicted.&rsquo; vol.
xxxiv. pp. 1486. See also vol. xxxv. pp. 609, 610. On the effect of the

that the bishop rightly estimated the danger to his own party; and as to
the Corporation and Test Acts, which, says another bishop (<i>Tomline's
Life of Pitt</i>, vol. ii. p. 604), &lsquo;were justly regarded as the firmest
bulwarks of the British constitution,&rsquo; the feeling was so strong, that
at an episcopal meeting in 1787, there were only two members who were
willing to repeal these persecuting laws. See <i>Bishop Watson's Life of

qu'il y a à en commettre, erreurs auxquelles la sagesse même quelquefois

conveys a truth which ought to repress that love of interfering with the
natural march of affairs which still characterizes politicians, even in
the freest countries.</p></div>
